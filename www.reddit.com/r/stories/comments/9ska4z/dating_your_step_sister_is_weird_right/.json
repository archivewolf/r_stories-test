I went to middle school with this kid (we\u2019ll call him F) and up until around 6th grade we were really good friends. We slowly drifted apart but we still kept each other in social media and all that good stuff. So I see him posting up this girl (we\u2019ll call her H), buying her stuff, and even posting sexual snaps of him grabbing her ass and her grinding on him and stuff like that. So obviously... I assume like any normal person that it\u2019s his girlfriend. But one day, I see her instagram. She had a post of her dad, saying happy Father\u2019s Day. But I know I\u2019ve seen this man before, he\u2019s F\u2019s moms husband. I almost died in that moment, so I went on some detective Sherlock Holmes shit to make sure I wasn\u2019t wrong about this. At this point I\u2019m 99% sure I\u2019m not, but I HAVE to ask. I ask, immediately he\u2019s defensive and mad. He also sees nothing wrong with this, and I know it\u2019s not technically illegal but like... still. But I end up getting threatened to be beat up, and ultimately blocked. But that\u2019s okay because I figure I\u2019ll never see these people again in my life, well I was wrong. I was at lunch during school today and guess who walks right by me? H. I wanted to post this all on Instagram but F\u2019s mom still follows me, and I\u2019m pretty positive his parents don\u2019t know they\u2019re dating. ",
