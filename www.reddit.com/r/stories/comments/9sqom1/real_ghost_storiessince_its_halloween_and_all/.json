Close friends that have zero reasons to make up such stories, and are extremely believable. There\u2019s a couple stories in particular that give me chills just thinking about.\n\nBoth a friend and I at the time were in our mid twenties.  He lived and still does live a little off the beaten path in Missouri.  He and his family were very close.  And though though I was living far away, knew just how close they were.  Alex and I guided in remote area's of Alaska together and spent months on end , seasonally, living in close quarters.  He's completely no non-sense, and one of the most genuine human beings I've ever gotten to know.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne night, sort of shooting the S\\*ht and hanging out after a long day, someone made a comment about a \"ghost\".   \n I can't remember how it came but, but I remember seeing Alex, who stands all of 6'5, 300+ lbs look sort of sheepishly down at the ground.  I could tell something was up.  Since we were roommates, and were with a number of other guys at that point, I figured I'd ask later what that was all about.  He got a real stern, and almost concerned look on his face like there was something he had to tell me.  And came the story.  I known he lost his Aunt who had a quick and unfortunate battle with cancer. What I didn't get when I found out she passed was the rest of the story.  She lived about 30 mins from he and his wife, and inherited the Aunt's house. They had already planned on moving there as it\u2019s closer to his work and a better school, and it was in fact his Aunts wish that they do so. A couple days after her passing he went to the house to start gathering her belongings and cleaning out the house so they could begin their move in. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlex, the friend I\u2019m relating the story from worked late doing all of this cleaning on a Friday after work, and planned to start first thing in the morning on Saturday. He decided to stay the night in his old room at the Aunts house where he would stay as a kid.\n\nAnd in vivid detail described to me\n\n\u201cI woke up, paralyzed but extremely calm and comforted to see my Aunt, radiant and healthy as ever sitting on the edge of my bed with her hand on my leg under the covers. She told me she was feeling better, and was so excited to have me raise my family in her home. She told him that heaven is real, to watch out for the family and give nothing but love to anyone who came in the house\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSeems normal right, but then he said \n\n\"**She also told me the real reason why my mom and her stopped talking years ago\u201d...**\n\nAlex, my friend, brought this up later to his mom a few days after this encounter with encouragement from his wife, since he spoken to her regarding what happened.  Alex Said \"My mom went white when I asked her if the reason her and Aunt Jeanie stopped talking because of a long lost sister that was adopted at birth\".   Which, apparently there was a third sister besides Mom and Aunt Jeanie.  Aunt Jeanie had just recently, with the internet, tracked her down.  I wanted to ask why, Mom didn't want her to be involved in the family, but I'm assuming it was money related, though I never asked.  ",
