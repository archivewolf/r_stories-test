But through the years things keep happen, one centimeter at the time the distance between us grew, and we found us to be so divided that nothing seemed to be fixable.\n\nThey don\u2019t tell you you will have less sex, you will touch less.. it's not 'cause of the scars,not only. It's more about the change, she won't really accept at all the new she, you, me won't never be able to act exactly like the way before. At the beginning I was afraid I can hurt, than I wasn't sure I was doing right and than the time passed and things got more difficult. She we\u2019ll be so depressed and angry someday that won\u2019t even talk; they don\u2019t tell you that your life goes on in th meanwhile, that you\u2019ll be distracted from other things in life, that when the fear of loss we\u2019ll be less oppressive a sense of lack will constantly eat you from the inside.. I\u2019m the lucky one, I\u2019m not the sick one, so I should be grateful, I should just be supportive, understanding, I don\u2019t have reasons to complain, but I can assure you, as much as I cannot understand how hard is to have cancer, you won\u2019t imagine how difficult is to be by side of someone who keeps pushing you away and accusing you not to be there at the same time. And believe me, I\u2019m definitely not putting the blame on the other half, I\u2019m just telling exactly the way the story goes.\n\nWe met a lot of couples that exploded during that period, just after receiving the \u201csad news\u201d, during the chemo, soon after finishing the cure.. it\u2019s a such hard period that is comprehensible life get revolved, I\u2019ve finished judicing long time ago.\n\nI cheated on her, she cheated on me, we have been mean too, we cried, she more than me.\n\nAfter 5 years we are still here, we are still together and we are still in love, but we are different, we love each other in different ways, we feel in different ways and we live differently.\n\nI can tell you, the shadow of the cancer is always behind us, I can tell you by lookingher eyes, that light veil of sadness, that little sense of concern coming and going some days, but we made a choice, stay together, face together whatever will come and live our life \u201cwith a smile\u201d as she always says.",
