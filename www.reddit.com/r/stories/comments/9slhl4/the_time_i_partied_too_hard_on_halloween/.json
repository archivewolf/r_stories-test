I  figured going to this party was going to be good for me. I had every  intention to meet people and have a good time. I didn\u2019t have a costume,  but I slapped on some black and white face paint and made myself a very  shoddy-looking skull face. I thought it was cool at the time. Looking  back at my selfie, however, I can see how terrible it looked.\n\nAnyway, I showed up at this party and the friend who invited me was  nowhere to be found. I called him on the phone and he said he had to run  out real quick, but he would be back. OK cool. I waited for him.  Luckily, I knew one of the party hosts. She was a mutual friend of the  guy who invited me. Instead of a *\u201cWho are you, and why are you at my house\u201d* moment, I was warmly welcomed by an old acquaintance.\n\nIt was her apartment, and she had a couple of roommates. One of these  roommates was actually really attractive and made nice conversation  with me. Unfortunately both her boyfriend and her father were at the  party. I decided to move on.\n\nThe place was more packed with people than I realized. The party  stretched into the room next door, and even outside to a large rooftop  balcony. This meant I could excuse myself from the claustrophobic room  full of strangers and revitalize myself with some fresh air and a  cigarette. \u201c*Where the hell was my friend?\u201d* I kept wondering. I  checked up on him a couple times. I even reached out to a couple of  other friends to see if they wanted to stop by, but they were busy.\n\nEventually my friend did show up, but he kept leaving for some  reason. I was a little pissed off to say the least, but this was still a  cool party and I had nothing better to do. So I stayed for a while and  decided I would try to fit in and have a good time.\n\n#### \n\n#### This is where things get weird.\n\nI should have gone home. Instead I made small talk with a few people  and tried to fit in. I sipped on a couple beers and left my comfort zone  enough to talk to a few people. I tried talking to women, mostly. But  somehow I ended up being followed around by some older guy for the rest  of the night.\n\nHe seemed cool at first. We took a couple shots and talked about life  and family. His daughter was actually the hot roommate I talked about  earlier. He was a single middle-aged man trying to fit in with his  daughter\u2019s friends and people half his age. Clearly he must have felt  about as out of place as I did.\n\nWe took another shot. I was ready to call it quits and sober up for  the night. I still had to drive home later. But this guy wanted to rage  and handed me more shots. Now, totally drunk and needing to get away  from the peer pressure, I slipped out to the roof for another cigarette.  Maybe the cold air and nicotine would help me sober up a bit. By this  time I was totally messed up, though, and when some girl in the hallway  handed me a cookie I didn\u2019t hesitate to cram it in my mouth.\n\n#### \n\n#### I shouldn\u2019t have eaten the cookie.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn case you\u2019re not following, this wasn\u2019t a regular cookie. It was a  special cookie, and I had a low tolerance it. So this time when the guy  managed to make his way outside and find me, I started to lose it.\n\nI didn\u2019t get violent or angry. No, I got paranoid. I can\u2019t remember  what he was saying to me, but he started really freaking me out. It was  probably nothing to worry about. I think he was probably talking about  his divorce or something normal like that. But I was suddenly terrified  and I had to leave immediately. I called my friend again, but he wasn\u2019t  around. I told him I had to leave.\n\nI slipped away from the party as quickly and covertly as possible and  made my way back down the street to my car. There was no way in hell  that I should have been driving, but I was in a panic and I couldn\u2019t  stay there.\n\nI couldn\u2019t go home, either. I was in no state to face my mother. I  didn\u2019t want her to see how messed up I was or how I drove home heavily  under the influence. I didn\u2019t want the confrontation and I didn\u2019t want  to give her a heart attack either.\n\nSo I drove. When I got to my neighborhood I kept on driving. I ended  up stopping at a Walmart parking lot down the street from my  neighborhood. It was open 24 hours. It was late, but there were people  around and I didn\u2019t feel too suspicious.\n\nI didn\u2019t want to sit in the car, though. I vaguely remember going  inside and walking a lap around the store and calling one of my friends  on the phone for no reason other than to say I was freaking out.\n\nI went back to the car. I passed out. I threw up. I passed out again. I threw up again. The sun came up. I drove home.\n\n#### \n\n#### Not my finest moment.\n\nThe party was cool, but I didn\u2019t intend to spend the night yacking  and sleeping alone in my car in a Walmart parking lot. I had high hopes  for the evening, but I ended up feeling lower than low. I still feel  ashamed when I look back.  \n\n\nWhat was the lesson learned here? Clearly there were many mistakes  made. I shouldn\u2019t have given into the peer pressure and drunk so much. I  shouldn\u2019t have taken the cookie. I shouldn\u2019t have been smoking  cigarettes (although completely unrelated). Most of all, I shouldn\u2019t  have driven. I can\u2019t imagine the horror my life would be today if I had  crashed into someone that night.\n\nLuckily no one was harmed. Apparently my mom had been calling me all  night, worried sick, though. I must have been already passed out in the  car. I had to explain the next morning why I didn\u2019t come home or answer  her calls. I didn\u2019t give all the shameful details. I just told her I had  a little too much to drink and couldn\u2019t drive home. Also, I was sorry  and I must have been asleep when she called.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n#### Happy Halloween, folks. Be safe, and be kind.\n\n[https://100mistakes.blog/mistake-3-the-time-i-partied-too-hard-on-halloween/](https://100mistakes.blog/mistake-3-the-time-i-partied-too-hard-on-halloween/)",
