We\u2019ll continue with events that happened about a year after what happened in my first semester of kindergarten. For those who are new here, we won\u2019t be able to catch you up because there is too much that you\u2019ve missed. The government hasn\u2019t done anything bad this far into our lives, but they have done bad to millions in this world. We\u2019ll see how far our encryption will allow us to take y\u2019all since the last time we spoke.\n\n We\u2019re going to start on two weeks before Christmas when we were talking about how Santa delivered all the presents in one night. Like every other group of kids, there was one of us who didn\u2019t believe that he was alone when he delivered the presents. The person in our group that didn\u2019t believe that Santa could work alone was John. Once our parents heard us talking about it, they told us that Santa had some trained elves that would enter certain houses while he directed his cloaked ship. When we heard this, Josh caught on with the lie asking, \u201cDoesn\u2019t Santa drive a sleigh with twelve popular reindeer?\u201d\n\n Mr. Morris then thought quick and told us that it was the cloaking device on the space ship disguising itself as a sleigh. While some of us were convinced, some of us didn\u2019t believe that Santa had technology that was years ahead of what was out in the market, or thought to be out in the military. After a few minutes of our parents trying to convince us that they weren\u2019t lying, we finally gave up, and let our parents believe that they convinced us. Right when our parents left, we started to talk about the correlation of elves and midgets.\n\nWhen we were done with Santa and everything surrounding Christmas lore, we started to think if our parents received or bought the presents before Christmas and put them under the Christmas tree Christmas night. We planned to check our basements one night and our attics the next until Christmas Night to make sure that our parents didn\u2019t have any presents.  We didn\u2019t actually start looking until the two nights before Christmas. The first night we didn\u2019t see anything because we looked in the wrong spot. On the cusp of the afternoon and dusk of Christmas Eve while our parents were finishing food for our Christmas dinner, we saw the presents in our individual attics.\n\nWe eventually went outside to play a little before dinner so that we could eat enough food tonight. The only ones that didn\u2019t look for the presents were the Bennett Sisters. When our parents told us that it was time for dinner, we let the Bennett sisters go so that we could start talking about the presents. We started to group up and as soon as we were close enough for nobody to hear us John started to flip out. Right when he started to flip out, we had to calm him down so none of our parents would notice. Consequently the nosy kid in the block was out and saw us have to calm John down, came and wanted to know what was happening. When he began speaking, we all shouted over him screaming, \u201cShut up Kyle!!!!\u201d\n\nRight after that, he ran off and we started to talk about what we saw. Josh was the first one who started to shout in a whispered form. Maddie start to cry right when Josh ended talking, with David hugging her for comfort. While she was crying, we continued talking about the presents and our parents betrayal against our trust. After a few minutes of us talking, My mom came out and told us that we had to come in because the food was going to get cold, and our the prayer was going to start in a bit. When she was done, I told everyone, \u201cWe\u2019ll discuss this tomorrow afternoon after playing with our new toys.\u201d \n\nWe huddled up and I picked Shaw to pick our huddle break.  He screamed out, \u201cUNBREAKABLE ON THREE\u2026 ONE, TWO, THREE\u2026\u201d We all then screamed unbreakable in unison like a sports team right before and after the game. Right after, we ate dinner and had fun for a little while. This year we started a new tradition were on midnight we sung Jesus happy birthday. Right after singing, we had our annual Secret Santa, and it lasted for about an hour or so. When finished with Secret Santa we all cleaned up and went home for an early Christmas morning.\n\nThe morning after we found woke up and went down to see what presents we had that Christmas. Each one of us gravitated towards our largest presents first, but our parents told us to save them for last. When all of the smaller toys were opened the big one and when opened, we saw that we each had telescopes. We all noticed that we received the presents that we wanted and very little candy. A few moments later we went outside to play with each other for the rest of the day.\n\nRight when the Bennett sisters were too tired hang out with us, they went home, while we stayed outside.\n\nAs soon as we noticed their door close we stopped playing our game of tag. We instantly started to talk about what went on talking about how we were going to keep our own secrets. Jarrod then said, \u201cHave any of y\u2019all ever heard of the story of secret societies?\u201d He was the only one of the group to hear about it at this point from one of the other students in school. We all told him to tell us what they were in the old campfire, ghost story manner. What he told us was that there are several secretive groups that control the different workforce sectors and influenced our every move. I was the first one that was convinced of creating a secret society of our own. While he finished his story, I tried to focus on a way on how to convince everyone else outside to create our own form of a secret society.\n\nEventually he finished and I started to plant the seeds of secrecy. While everyone were trying to think of a way to rebel their own way, my plan was kicking in. Everyone wanted to push my idea away, even though they knew that it was our best option. The first person to join the cause was David, and then one by one. The most reluctant person to join the cause was Katherine, it took us about seven minutes of convincing from everyone to get her to join. After Katie joined us, Derrick said that we had to go home and get play with our toys.\n\nAs soon as midnight came, we all arrived right outside her window. She had a place where she had found a while she was bored one day during the fall that she thought looked cool. Before we started to move, I asked everyone, \u201cDoes everyone have what we need???\u201d Everyone said that they had everything that we needed. Jacob told everyone to stay partnered up, and to stay within inches of the others. We started following Hailey to the spot had in mind for us for about five minutes to get there. John started to complain three minutes into the walking to our destination.\n\nWhen we arrived to a little spot that had some rocks big enough for fifteen teenagers to sit around, Hailey said, \u201cIs this good enough for you John???\u201d He stopped complaining and responded with, \u201cFor sure this is good enough for me!!!\u201d I followed up by telling everyone to get enough wood and rocks to make a big enough fire to heat us up. It took us about seven minutes to get enough twigs and rocks to make a fire. Before sitting down Josh, Tyler, and I had a few rules that we had to tell everyone else. The first rule was to pick a partner and to stick by their side at all times. The second rule was that they could never tell anyone about what we did at any cost. And the final rule was to do never break our vows we were going to take that night.\n\nWe all raised our hands and Jarrod began telling us to repeat the vows after him. The vows were all but meaningless to any of us when we started this. \u201cI vow to never betray the people I call family as long as I belong to this society. None of the decisions that I make will ever compromise the livelihood of our existence. We only bring light to the world we belong to, for I represent honor, respect, love. We protect the innocent from the hands of danger for the existence of the group. We have become The Fort.\u201d\n\nAfter the vows, we then decided that the first meeting of every week should always be scary stories night. We only told about five stories due to scaring each other with the fact that we were in the woods in between every story. When finished and poured the fire out before leaving our new sight. By the time we were back in the neighborhood, we have realized that it was one in the morning. We all went to each of our houses and helped ourselves get into our rooms before we went back to sleep. Hailey was the last to go back to her house because she was the only one to have a bedroom in the first floor.\n\nAfter a few meetings, we started to get a hold of things were becoming for us. We eventually came to an understanding that there would be no leader, and everyone would have an equal voice. Our Treasurer was John, since he could manage his allowances a little bit better than everyone else. The Secretary we chose was Katie since she liked keeping attendance like a teacher would. Madeline was in charge of the checking the things we brought every night. The last position we gave someone was Timekeeper, and was given to Jarrod since he was extremely punctual and had a watch on him at all times. We all agreed that we would always meet in our spot at midnight, and leave either at one on the dot or one-thirty every night. Since our parents always made us go to church on Sunday, we would never meet in between Saturday and Sunday to stay awake in church.\n\nOn our first week\u2019s anniversary we tried to celebrate somehow. Early that day we tried to plan everything out since it was New Year\u2019s Eve. David had the great idea of having our meeting right after our parents tuck us in, and taking some of the sodas and juices over to the \u201cFortsight.\u201d We all agreed to what David said, and snuck out after being tucked into our beds. After being at the sight, singing our favorite songs and telling mildly scary ghost stories, we went back home. When arriving to my home and back into bed, we noticed that it was around two twenty-three in the morning.\n\nThe next night when we met, we concentrated the meeting on returning to school that following Monday. We all talked about how we wanted to do some interesting game, read an great book, or new exercise that could strengthen us better. We then remembered that we would most likely have to stop our meetings for school. Shaw then remembered that we all received walkie-talkies, binoculars, and telescopes. Derrick then said, \u201cWe could change the time we meet, and use our walkie-talkies and binoculars to talk to each other from our rooms.\u201d When finished, we all agreed to have our meetings by walkie-talkies and binoculars until each semester ended or until we were old enough to sneak out as teens usually did.\n\nThe first night we started the last semester of the school year, we started our meeting at our individual rooms. Our queue to start the meeting was when we heard two clicks on our walkie-talkies. When ten thirty came, I clicked my walkie-talkie twice so that everybody would know that it was time. The first person to talk was John, asking us what we should do tomorrow during recess since it was a new semester. We each started to talk about how we should start doing more things together. I then said, \u201cWe should actually getting our own circles so that we could get more used to what the real world is going to be like.\u201d Everyone was reluctant to admit that I was right for about a minute. After a minute of silence, everybody started to agree. I told them that we would still meet at our secret society at nights.\n\nWhen that following night came, Katie was the one to click her walkie-talkie at the same time as I did the night before. We talked about our search was going for new circles was coming along. The one who was having the most problem was Maddie, since she was the most introverted of the group. We eventually started help her get a new group of friends to make it easier for her to become a little more extroverted. After getting her a group where she could be by herself and not be by Katie\u2019s side all day long. When she described us her new group of friends, she told us the exact description of a group of hippies. Half way into the explanation, we all started to laugh because we all thought that hippies were the funniest type of people.\n\nWith our new friends, we decided that we would have each other\u2019s backs before anyone outside of the group. On our third night while talking about our outside groups, we decided that we would watch each one of the groups we were a part of, to make sure there weren\u2019t any \u201cthreats.\u201d Our only question was for how long we should scout all of the groups and how stealthily. Jarrod said that more than a week of coming up daily and asking questions, and each group would start getting suspicious. I thought that one pair of Fort partners should search a group every three days so that we would look less suspicious, and then another pair of partners until we scout like the former pair. The only difference each pair would change is their patterns of going to each group from the previous pairs.\n\nAfter all of us went through with checking each other\u2019s groups, our suspicions grew towards most of the people in them. We decided that the night the we were done observing each group, we would tell our findings to each other. Tonight, Josh introduced the clicking ceremony to start the meeting. We went group by group deciding if the person should stay in that group or leave the group. The first group we picked for discussion was John\u2019s since he was the toughest to decide if he should stay or leave. We decided to end on Mary\u2019s group since we gave her the \u201cperfect\u201d group and she already told us about how they acted.\n\nWhen coming to our conclusion, we chose to vote on what we should do with each of our groups. Our votes on what decision to pick took several tries due to us not being able to choose a single way of how to manage each of the groups. After about four or five times, Derrick decided that it would be a better idea for us to have each other\u2019s backs just in case one of us had a fight with someone in outside of our group. With Derrick\u2019s comment in the air, we decided to choose his idea, and have each other\u2019s backs even when we had our other groups backing us in a fight. With our conclusion finished, we ended our meeting for the night and went to sleep right after.\n\nOn the first Monday of March, we had our weekly Scarefest Night. For the first night of the semester, we went back to the Fortsight. After a few months of scary stories, we\u2019ve became used to scary stories. Our first story started at the fear factor of sixth graders while we were four and five year old\u2019s. Jarrod began his version of the story of The Hook where the boyfriend is hung on top of a 1966 Chevelle SS while his girlfriend waited in the car for him to reenter the car. David followed up with the story of the Krampus on Christmas night while everyone slept peacefully. When most of us ended, Madeline was the last to start her story, which was Bloody Mary, where Mary could leave teleport through the mirror and kill teens that had premarital sex. When we ended, we mentioned how we should talk about doing new things for the group following night.\n\nWhen we were in recess the following day, we decided that we should play tag football until the end of the school day. The team captains were Josh and I, with Josh being first pick and me getting the ball first. While we played, the teachers watched so that nothing would happen like the year before where Josh raged out of control. Mr. Freeman was looking out for the Kindergarteners since they were even more fragile than us first graders. We played for the most of the hour besides half time and when it was time for us to go. As soon as it was time for us to go back inside, Josh\u2019s team threw a Hail Mary, which I intercepted a pass which Josh threw. Unlike John, Josh had more control of his emotions when it came to fair plays.\n\nWhen day came to night, we waited for midnight to come for us to go to the Fortsight. With seven minutes to go, we all met in front of the window of Hailey\u2019s room. We had to wait for her since she hadn\u2019t come out yet, and she typically took us to the Sight. Our impatience beat us, from waiting for her, so most of us went without her since we\u2019ve become used to our route. The person who stayed was her partner, or Josh. Hailey came out three minutes late, so they had to run so that they wouldn\u2019t be late for the opening ceremony. By the time they arrived, we were raising our hands to start the ceremony. If they would have missed just a fraction what we were going to say, they would have to do some type of exercise until we finished.\n\nWhen the OC (Opening Ceremony) ended, we sat down and started to discuss what new activities we should have for following meetings. Josh decided that we should start dedicating each meeting to a certain things that would benefit us. We decided to vote as usual, and one by one we each gave our votes on the idea. After each one of us went by, we had a unanimous agreement on progressive meetings. We each said things we knew we needed, like physical and mental progression, knowledge, hiding skills, and more. Each meeting had were designated to specific occurrences like every other meeting. While this was occurring, Oakley was watching us in secret wondering what was happening.",

She had a place where she had found a while she was bored one day during the fall that she thought looked cool. Before we started to move, I asked everyone, \u201cDoes everyone have what we need???\u201d Everyone said that they had everything that we needed. Jacob told everyone to stay partnered up, and to stay within inches of the others. We started following Hailey to the spot had in mind for us for about five minutes to get there. John started to complain three minutes into the walking to our destination.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When we arrived to a little spot that had some rocks big enough for fifteen teenagers to sit around, Hailey said, \u201cIs this good enough for you John???\u201d He stopped complaining and responded with, \u201cFor sure this is good enough for me!!!\u201d I followed up by telling everyone to get enough wood and rocks to make a big enough fire to heat us up. It took us about seven minutes to get enough twigs and rocks to make a fire. Before sitting down Josh, Tyler, and I had a few rules that we had to tell everyone else. The first rule was to pick a partner and to stick by their side at all times. The second rule was that they could never tell anyone about what we did at any cost. And the final rule was to do never break our vows we were going to take that night.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We all raised our hands and Jarrod began telling us to repeat the vows after him. The vows were all but meaningless to any of us when we started this. \u201cI vow to never betray the people I call family as long as I belong to this society. None of the decisions that I make will ever compromise the livelihood of our existence. We only bring light to the world we belong to, for I represent honor, respect, love. We protect the innocent from the hands of danger for the existence of the group. We have become The Fort.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After the vows, we then decided that the first meeting of every week should always be scary stories night. We only told about five stories due to scaring each other with the fact that we were in the woods in between every story. When finished and poured the fire out before leaving our new sight. By the time we were back in the neighborhood, we have realized that it was one in the morning. We all went to each of our houses and helped ourselves get into our rooms before we went back to sleep. Hailey was the last to go back to her house because she was the only one to have a bedroom in the first floor.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After a few meetings, we started to get a hold of things were becoming for us. We eventually came to an understanding that there would be no leader, and everyone would have an equal voice. Our Treasurer was John, since he could manage his allowances a little bit better than everyone else. The Secretary we chose was Katie since she liked keeping attendance like a teacher would. Madeline was in charge of the checking the things we brought every night. The last position we gave someone was Timekeeper, and was given to Jarrod since he was extremely punctual and had a watch on him at all times. We all agreed that we would always meet in our spot at midnight, and leave either at one on the dot or one-thirty every night. Since our parents always made us go to church on Sunday, we would never meet in between Saturday and Sunday to stay awake in church.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On our first week\u2019s anniversary we tried to celebrate somehow. Early that day we tried to plan everything out since it was New Year\u2019s Eve. David had the great idea of having our meeting right after our parents tuck us in, and taking some of the sodas and juices over to the \u201cFortsight.\u201d We all agreed to what David said, and snuck out after being tucked into our beds. After being at the sight, singing our favorite songs and telling mildly scary ghost stories, we went back home. When arriving to my home and back into bed, we noticed that it was around two twenty-three in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The next night when we met, we concentrated the meeting on returning to school that following Monday. We all talked about how we wanted to do some interesting game, read an great book, or new exercise that could strengthen us better. We then remembered that we would most likely have to stop our meetings for school. Shaw then remembered that we all received walkie-talkies, binoculars, and telescopes. Derrick then said, \u201cWe could change the time we meet, and use our walkie-talkies and binoculars to talk to each other from our rooms.\u201d When finished, we all agreed to have our meetings by walkie-talkies and binoculars until each semester ended or until we were old enough to sneak out as teens usually did.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The first night we started the last semester of the school year, we started our meeting at our individual rooms. Our queue to start the meeting was when we heard two clicks on our walkie-talkies. When ten thirty came, I clicked my walkie-talkie twice so that everybody would know that it was time. The first person to talk was John, asking us what we should do tomorrow during recess since it was a new semester. We each started to talk about how we should start doing more things together. I then said, \u201cWe should actually getting our own circles so that we could get more used to what the real world is going to be like.\u201d Everyone was reluctant to admit that I was right for about a minute. After a minute of silence, everybody started to agree. I told them that we would still meet at our secret society at nights.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When that following night came, Katie was the one to click her walkie-talkie at the same time as I did the night before. We talked about our search was going for new circles was coming along. The one who was having the most problem was Maddie, since she was the most introverted of the group. We eventually started help her get a new group of friends to make it easier for her to become a little more extroverted. After getting her a group where she could be by herself and not be by Katie\u2019s side all day long. When she described us her new group of friends, she told us the exact description of a group of hippies. Half way into the explanation, we all started to laugh because we all thought that hippies were the funniest type of people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With our new friends, we decided that we would have each other\u2019s backs before anyone outside of the group. On our third night while talking about our outside groups, we decided that we would watch each one of the groups we were a part of, to make sure there weren\u2019t any \u201cthreats.\u201d Our only question was for how long we should scout all of the groups and how stealthily. Jarrod said that more than a week of coming up daily and asking questions, and each group would start getting suspicious. I thought that one pair of Fort partners should search a group every three days so that we would look less suspicious, and then another pair of partners until we scout like the former pair. The only difference each pair would change is their patterns of going to each group from the previous pairs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After all of us went through with checking each other\u2019s groups, our suspicions grew towards most of the people in them. We decided that the night the we were done observing each group, we would tell our findings to each other. Tonight, Josh introduced the clicking ceremony to start the meeting. We went group by group deciding if the person should stay in that group or leave the group. The first group we picked for discussion was John\u2019s since he was the toughest to decide if he should stay or leave. We decided to end on Mary\u2019s group since we gave her the \u201cperfect\u201d group and she already told us about how they acted.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When coming to our conclusion, we chose to vote on what we should do with each of our groups. Our votes on what decision to pick took several tries due to us not being able to choose a single way of how to manage each of the groups. After about four or five times, Derrick decided that it would be a better idea for us to have each other\u2019s backs just in case one of us had a fight with someone in outside of our group. With Derrick\u2019s comment in the air, we decided to choose his idea, and have each other\u2019s backs even when we had our other groups backing us in a fight. With our conclusion finished, we ended our meeting for the night and went to sleep right after.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On the first Monday of March, we had our weekly Scarefest Night. For the first night of the semester, we went back to the Fortsight. After a few months of scary stories, we\u2019ve became used to scary stories. Our first story started at the fear factor of sixth graders while we were four and five year old\u2019s. Jarrod began his version of the story of The Hook where the boyfriend is hung on top of a 1966 Chevelle SS while his girlfriend waited in the car for him to reenter the car. David followed up with the story of the Krampus on Christmas night while everyone slept peacefully. When most of us ended, Madeline was the last to start her story, which was Bloody Mary, where Mary could leave teleport through the mirror and kill teens that had premarital sex. When we ended, we mentioned how we should talk about doing new things for the group following night.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When we were in recess the following day, we decided that we should play tag football until the end of the school day. The team captains were Josh and I, with Josh being first pick and me getting the ball first. While we played, the teachers watched so that nothing would happen like the year before where Josh raged out of control. Mr. Freeman was looking out for the Kindergarteners since they were even more fragile than us first graders. We played for the most of the hour besides half time and when it was time for us to go. As soon as it was time for us to go back inside, Josh\u2019s team threw a Hail Mary, which I intercepted a pass which Josh threw. Unlike John, Josh had more control of his emotions when it came to fair plays.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When day came to night, we waited for midnight to come for us to go to the Fortsight. With seven minutes to go, we all met in front of the window of Hailey\u2019s room. We had to wait for her since she hadn\u2019t come out yet, and she typically took us to the Sight. Our impatience beat us, from waiting for her, so most of us went without her since we\u2019ve become used to our route. The person who stayed was her partner, or Josh. Hailey came out three minutes late, so they had to run so that they wouldn\u2019t be late for the opening ceremony. By the time they arrived, we were raising our hands to start the ceremony. If they would have missed just a fraction what we were going to say, they would have to do some type of exercise until we finished.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When the OC (Opening Ceremony) ended, we sat down and started to discuss what new activities we should have for following meetings. Josh decided that we should start dedicating each meeting to a certain things that would benefit us. We decided to vote as usual, and one by one we each gave our votes on the idea. After each one of us went by, we had a unanimous agreement on progressive meetings. We each said things we knew we needed, like physical and mental progression, knowledge, hiding skills, and more. Each meeting had were designated to specific occurrences like every other meeting. While this was occurring, Oakley was watching us in secret wondering what was happening.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
