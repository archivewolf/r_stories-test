I wanted to fall back to sleep so badly but I knew I had to be at NASA in about an hour for some mysterious meeting that I was called for. I go to my shower and say the words \u201cpower on\u201d and my shower turns on automatically. After my shower, I eat two pieces of toast and rush to my car. Traffic was fairly easy probably because it was a Saturday and nobody hardly worked on a Saturday. When I got to NASA I met with the head of command, his name is Richard Simmons and he immediately told me to sit down in a chair. He went over a plan that was kind of mind-boggling that it made me kind of nervous. It was called Osiris 1 and it was a space mission to the Andromeda galaxy. He wanted me to do the mission because I was one of the best pilots in the world at the time. \u201cDaniel I know it\u2019s a lot but I need you to trust me on this mission, if everything goes well you should be on a new planet in less than 200 years\u201d he said. 200 years? I won\u2019t be able to see my family ever again if I do this mission. I know you are upset but you are only hope to explore this new planet, if you go your family will be well taken care of while you\u2019re gone he said. Why are you willing to waste resources on a planet that is 1 to 2 light years away? Our planet is not going to survive the next 300 years. Water level is rising do to the poles melting and food is running short he refuted. Ever since the mars 2050 mission, NASA wanted to visit the far reaches of our solar system because earth\u2019s natural resources were depleting. In 2080 men built a space station outside the orbit of Pluto the mission was funded by the U.S government and ever since then NASA has flown multiple missions to deliver supplies. How long until we take off? \u201cGive or take 6 months \u201c. I accepted the mission but on one condition, I needed to be given the Medal of Honor when I came home. I knew this wasn\u2019t going to be easy telling my dad, he was already dealing with the loss of my mom. My mom passed away when a car slid off the road and smashed head on into her. I miss her and so does my dad, that\u2019s why I can\u2019t tell him immediately. I wasn\u2019t informed until the months leading up to the mission that a girl would be joining me. Her name on the letter said Emily Walker, she was an exemplary pilot she had flown a couple of missions to Pluto and back. She was also intelligent, she graduated from Harvard with a 4.2. When I felt like it was the right time I went to my dad\u2019s home to tell him the news about the mission. I noticed right away that he was on the verge of tears and I can\u2019t blame him losing your whole family to events like these is definitely upsetting. I comforted him for the next 6 months until the launch. I got a call from NASA on July 6th telling me that I needed to meet them for a briefing. There I got to meet Emily my co-pilot, my first impressions with her were great. Richard told me that when I got to the planet I needed to deploy a beacon that would send a signal back to NASA. He also told me the name of the planet \u201cvector 1b\u201d. It was finally launch day, the air felt humid and the air was blowing rather heavily. We both were loaded on the ship and were put into hyper sleep pods. All I remember hearing the doctor counting backwards from 100. When she got to 50 I woke up and remember seeing Emily\u2019s pod on the other side of me. I pulled the emergency lever to get out and not even 5 minutes later Emily is out of her pod gasping for air. I went to go see what instructions was left for us, I found\n\na message on the main console of the ship it read that there was enough food to last for 3 months and that we needed to maintain the ships integrity until we land. We both ate packets of food when we got out because we were both starving. And while we were eating we both got to know each other better. I asked her things like what was her hobbies back on earth? She answered with drawing and writing. She also asked me what my favorite hobbies were and I said that I loved to work on technology. Emily pulled up the location of the ship while I went to check for damages. Luckily no parts were damaged and the ship still had plenty of backup fuel to make it to vector 1b. The rest of the flight I got to know Emily so well. We would talk about our childhood experiences, our dreams growing up and our goals for when we get to the new planet. She said when she gets to this new planet she wants to find the best garden and she wants to also find life. Finally, the planet comes into our vision and we see that it\u2019s almost identical to earth but it has different shaped continents. We knew right then and there that there was no turning back",
