I have been apart of everything you\u2019ve ever done, though you never knew of my existence. I knew what you\u2019ve always wanted, I knew what you wanted to become, i knew what you\u2019ve never told others, I knew your deepest feelings, I knew it all. You wanted someone that would understand you. You wanted companionship. You wanted nothing more than someone to pay attention. However you dreamed of people noticing your accomplishments and when you failed you wanted someone to give you a hand. You wanted someone to tell you it was going to be okay. But instead you got criticism. no one payed attention. your mind as well as your heart, weakened by the criticism you\u2019ve always faced and both begged for someone to believe in you. When people criticized you for your failures you fell and it only drove you deeper and deeper into the ground, slowly disappearing into the sinkhole others have created for you. Eventually you stopped trying, the effort was no longer there. And every time you tried you always fell back down. You blamed not yourself but others for discouraging you. When we both knew what anyone said never mattered, you couldn\u2019t help but to care. You believed what they said. You believed when they called you \u201cdumb\u201d. You believed when they called you names like \u201cstupid\u201d, \u201cidiot\u201d, \u201cdumbass\u201d. You took it all. When they said you couldn\u2019t do it you believed. When no one noticed the work you were most proud of, it ruined your spirits. You\u2019d go to your room and cry as you wondered why no one cared.... I wrote you this letter to tell you I saw your accomplishments. I wrote you this letter to tell you what you\u2019ve always wanted to hear... I\u2019m proud of you. What you\u2019re proud has never been unnoticed, for I have been there through it all. I saw the work you put in. i saw the effort. I felt what you felt as you were putting the last bit of touches on all your masterpieces. The excitement you felt when you were about to show it to someone. I felt it. And when they didn\u2019t care Just know I\u2019ve always been proud of you.\n\n\n\n\nA letter to me. ",
