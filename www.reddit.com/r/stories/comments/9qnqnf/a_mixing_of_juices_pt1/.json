So floppy; like a dilapidated ragdoll in a hot tempest, a pumpkinseed of my ancestors, swept across the fourth dimensional plane in a breeze of minty air. That which ebbed and flowed endlessly through the gutters of my soul, gutters steeped in grime and sweat; bloody sweat. But which flowed through, cleansing and purifying their sins, desalinizing their souls like paper wax, born of ashes into the world, a world so cruel a worm may writhe and not be helped. A world where that writhing worm may not find residence, cast out and shunned for its appearance, a bedraggled being considered as the very grime that clogs the sewers of their souls, the filth and antiseptic merging and intertwining, becoming as one. Two opposites come crashing together in a sea of righteous blasphemy, a final affront to the gods, before being rendered speechless by the waves of angst crashing through my head. A bottle.\n\nA bottle spins on its top, pushed forth by momentum of its own momentum, a catalyst of crusading forces, valiantly crying out as their men are ruthlessly slaughtered by the eerie wind resistance. The very air swirls with decay, the cries of two opposite forces battling against one another, of burning antiseptic and dark, vile grime; of momentum and air resistance, of life and death.\n\nO, it is only now I behold it! So splendid and large! A ripe tomato on the verge of bursting, a river of juices begins to flow, all that is good and dangly stands on end, like a tiger preparing its limbs to pounce upon its unsuspecting prey. It\u2019s large teeth dripping with the very saliva that drips from mine. Saliva that becomes the culmination of mucous and water, and sweet, sweet taste of victory oozes down her lips. Her lips as red as apples in a midsummer sun, shining bright with the ferocity of a thousand thousand catfish, catfish whose wives were taken and children murdered for cheap fish bait. Their wives diced and mixed with lemon juice, chili and thyme, a vile concoction of blasphemy, a final symphony, like that of the mixing of juices. Nothing else is as pungent, as intimate, as seductive as the mixing of juices. They were forced to watch the juices mix over the bodies of their dead wives, the wives they knew and loved, the wives they cared for, the wives who had loved them. Before being swept away by a decisive hand, guiding them with an almighty FWOOSH! Into the warm embrace of drunkenness. Its vile, blasphemous liquid burning like a strong acid, the grime and rust that encased their hearts like skin encases organs. They burned, they lusted for atonement, righteous atonement! For all the wrongs dealt to them like a casino dealing to the rich, like the evil dealing to the devil. And then a rage, a fiery anger, burning brighter than a thousand suns took them over, and cast them into the realms of men. Catfish in the realm of men.",
