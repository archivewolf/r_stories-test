But the mother of the Hare's wife was also a very pretty woman. One day she went to visit her daughter and Hare fell in love. His desire grew stronger every day, so he began to find out what to do in order to sleep with her. He watched the movements of the mother-in-law carefully and discovered first of all that she was very fond of basking in the sun. Every morning when the sun was sweet she would come out of the house and bask until it was time to eat the afternoon meal. The second thing that Hare discovered was that his mother-in-law always sat on the same spot. \nOne day very very early in the morning Hare went to that spot and scooped out the sand, put himself in the hole and covered himself so carefully that it was impossible to notice that there was anything unusual. Then when the sun has become sweet the mother-in-law came out of the house and went and sat in the exact same spot. \nThat day the sun was extremely sweet, and Hare's mother-in-law enjoyed it very much. She did not sit as usual, but moved about, now up and down, now sideways. O she moved a great deal and sweated and made sounds of enjoyment. Hare's mother-in-law enjoyed herself very deeply. \nIn the evening when the people were sitting around the evening fire a small piece of gourd began jumping up and down and singing the following song very softly:\n\nPengle-pengle-pengle-pengle.\n\nPengle-pengle-pengle-pengle. \n\nO Hare and his mother-in-law pengle,\n\nDid a certain thing very sweet, pengle,\n\nNuk-nuk-kanuk-kanuk nukere,\n\nNuk-nuk-kanuk-kanuk nukere.\n\nOnly Hare heard the soft song of the piece of gourd, so he took it in his hand and walked to the end of the swept compound and threw it very hard. But the piece of gourd flew zigzag through the air and came back to the fireplace and began to jump up and down and to sing more loudly:\n\nPengle-pengle-pengle-pengle.\n\nHare seized the piece of gourd and went into the house. He put it into a mortar and pounded it into powder. Then he put the powder into water and drank it up. \nWhen he came back to the fireplace someone asked him: 'Hare,what is wrong with you?'\n'Nothing, nothing, I am fine, very fine,' He replied. \nHare sat with the people around the fire until his stomach made a loud noise, and then he felt like defecating. He walked into the grass and squatted down. But when he tried to defecate the piece of gourd came out and flew back to the fireplace and began to jump up and down, singing very loudly\n\nPengle-pengle-pengle-pengle,\n\nPengle-pengle-pengle-pengle,\n\nHare and his mother-in-law,\n\nDid a certain thing very sweet,\n\nNuk-nuk-kanuk-kanuk-kanuk nukere,\n\nNuk-nuk-kanuk-kanuk-kanuk nukere.\n\nHare ran back to the fireplace but when he arrived the piece of gourd had already finished its song. And people knew that Hare and his mother-in-law had done something very sweet. \n Hare and his mother-in-law were very ashamed, for, as people say:'Even if you take you mother-in-law under the lake you will still be discovered.'\n",
