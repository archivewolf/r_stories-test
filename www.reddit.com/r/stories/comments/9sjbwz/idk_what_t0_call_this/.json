With every urge telling me not to, I still made my way there. Everything in me told me to stay back. I couldn't stay back though, I stood tall, my head hanging low. I was afraid of showing emotion. I could have been anywhere else besides here, I could have been using my time more wisely. Yet I still got in my car and drove to this spot, at this time. People were all spread out, some hugging each other, some sitting in lounge chairs watching slide shows, some in the break room eating cookies, some sitting down in the chairs they put out, children running around not understanding what had been going on, others with tears in their eyes even tissues in their hands. The guest of honor was in the front of the room, people had crowded him, giving him and his family flowers, like they had just done something wrong and were trying to make it up. I didn't go and visit him, and he sure and hell couldn't come over and visit me.  When everyone calmed down and walked away, my feet dragged me to him. My mind had been screaming at me, \u201cStop!\u201d it shouted, but my heart was leading me to him. My heart gave me courage. I was standing in front of him now, I felt eyes on the back of my neck, I felt as if everyone had stopped what they were doing to look at me, *\u201cwho was she?\u201d* they must have thought. I didn't know what to do, should I have knelt before him? Should I have prayed to him? Should I have whispered a sweet goodbye, before I turned away and left? \u201cI hope you ask God for forgiveness, I hope he lends you it, he will be your only hope,\u201d I whispered lightly like I was praying, but I had not prayed, I was talking to him. I stood in silence for a moment or two, maybe I was trying to dismay all the negative and positive thoughts and be in peace, maybe I was trying to show an act of respect. Then as I planned, I turned and walked myself to the door. As soon as I put my hand on the door, I felt a hand on my shoulder. It was his mother, she looked at me with glossy eyes. \u201cYou know he used to talk about you a lot,\u201d she told me \u201che did?\u201d I asked \u201che loved you\u201d she whispered faintly to me, in fear he might hear her if that had even been possible. \u201cI think you were the only girl who ever just... made him happy, and made him stronger\u2026 you took away his demons, he was different when he was with you,\u201d she admitted to me, I tried to hold back my laugh, if he loved me, why would he break me for fun? \u201cI'm sorry for your loss\u201d I changed the subject \u201cI'm sorry for your\u2019s honey\u201d she grabbed my hand \u201cdont be, I lost him a long time ago.\u201d I replied, pushing the door open, and leaving.
