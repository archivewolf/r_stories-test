I was playing Overwatch with my friend David who lives in Nebraska(knew him for a year or so at the time) which was basically the norm for us at the time. Now, David is the type of guy to act all independent but in reality, he really just likes to ride anyone's dick as long as he thinks they are cool. So on this day, he invites a girl to our play station party (not gonna put her username for privacy reasons). I find out her name is Sarah, she lives in Florida, used to date David a while back (they met in minecraft like 5 years ago), has a shit ton of mental illnesses, and is in a relationship she feels stuck in with a guy from Utah.\n\nOf course, being a teenager I was thirsty for some gamer girl coochie so I go ahead and try to do my best to be seductive which, to be honest, just consisted of me spamming \"I love you\" every minute or two. Surprisingly enough, David encouraged my advances. All 3 of us played Overwatch together for a couple weeks. Eventually one night, David said that Sarah would send me booty pics if I send him a photo of me(he's never seen my face). Me, not being an idiot, decided to agree to that. Once David sees my face he insists that I'm actually really attractive and that he should show Sarah. She loses her shit. I'm talking to the point where she is almost squealing because she thinks I am so cute. In the end, I did get those booty pics and god damn my bois. her body is an easy 8 to 9/10. Definitely someone I could see myself wanting to do shit with you know?\n\nThe day after she starts to show a whole lot more affection (not that I'm complaining). She claims she really does like me but she can't because shes with that guy from Utah. I learn his name is Tyler and that they've been talking for about 7 to 8 years. They've been a thing for a while but it's always been on and off. She sends me a picture of Tyler and holy fuck is he ugly. He looks like he is 5'2, had terrible, ugly blonde hair, and had about as much muscle as a baby. Not to mention he would always treat Sarah like shit daily and was all around a bad guy. I ask Sarah why shes even with this guy in the first place. It's not like he's good for her. She says it's because they've known each other for so long that it's hard to let go. When I hear that, my heart drops. I mean, it made no sense.\n\nNothing made sense. Why did she leave? Why did I even have feelings? I just started talking to her a week or so ago. I mean, she had a boyfriend, but I still cared for her. So I did what felt right. I told her straight up that Tyler is bad for her, does nothing but hurt her and takes her for granted and she agrees but it doesn't change anything. Me and Sarah would talk more and more as time passes. David hated it and to this day I still have no idea why. I have to assume he was jealous, but in retrospect, why would he be jealous. If anything he should've been worried for me.\n\nMe and Sarah would sext and shit from time to time and one day I went out and said, \"look babe, I wanna be with you, I really do. But if we're gonna be a thing, Tyler needs to go.\" And she made it happen. Just like that, she left Tyler for me. It almost felt too easy but she would send screenshots of Tyler trying to apologize and come back to her. Looking back on it, I feel bad for the guy.\n\nBut just like that, in the December of 2017 I got my early Christmas present in the form a girlfriend that I would grow to love, hate, and never forget.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHey so I hope you enjoyed if you read this far, I do plan on finishing this story. This was more or less just the setup, but I do intend to take my time with this, sorry if it's really long. I broke it into parts to make it more easily digestible. I plan on posting a new part everyday sometime in the afternoon. I hope you guys look forward to it. :)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-Sean",
