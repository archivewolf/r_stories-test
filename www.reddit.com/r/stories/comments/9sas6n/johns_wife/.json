The bold headline states that there is a hostage situation somewhere in the country, and police cannot seem to find the location. A video feed from the kidnapper comes in. A woman can be seen in the grainy video. Hands can be seen adjusting the focus until it lands perfectly on the woman\u2019s face. My heart skips a beat as I recognise my wife, her usually radiant face dishevelled and tired. Her hands seem to be tied to the ceiling and her feet are bound together. My own hands numbing at the thoughts of the things I would do the kidnapper if I ever crossed him. \n\nThe kidnapper comes on-screen, his face covered by a clown mask and his hands covered in leather gauntlets to seemingly cover hints of his age. He seems to be clad in an old-fashioned detective cape with a top hat. He begins to speak, his words rolling off his tongue in a heavy accent. \u2018You have 24 hours until this woman dies. If you try to retrieve her, she will be killed immediately\u2019. As he says this, he gestures to a timer on his right, the digits flashing 24:00:00 repeatedly, like a death toll, before beginning its countdown.\n\nI turn off the TV and jump off the sofa, trying to call 911 and alert them. But they seem to have beaten me, as I hear a sharp rap on the door just before a gruff, old voice calls out \u2018Police! Open up!\u2019. I run over and hurriedly unlock the door, denying them the chance to break it open. A gaggle of grown men in baby blue bulletproof vests face me, the ones in the rear flashing guns at me while the front line flashes their CID badges with a bored, if not completely uninterested, manner.\n\nI begin to sweat, scared that they have tagged me as a suspect and scared that they might waste time interrogating me, and ultimately, letting my wife die. I get on my knees and beg them for help amongst teary sobs. \u2018Now that\u2019s a weird one if I\u2019ve ever seen one.\u2019 A Wild Western accent gave him a slightly nasal voice to accompany his cowboy face. He helps me up, and I spot the badge on his breast-pocket. It read: DI TOM THORNE. I quake in fear as he gestures towards my couch to interrogate me.\n\nThey ask me about my wife, how much I loved her and her daily behaviour. They ask me about her relationships outside of work and her friends. They ask me about the intense argument we had in the morning, about all that I said and did to her. They rake through my mind about everything I knew about her and any of her correspondences. They ultimately ruled me as innocent, for an empty vessel holds nothing. \n\nAs they get up to leave with some of my wife\u2019s belongings, I ask for permission to participate in the investigation. DI Thorne promptly turns me down with the simple explanation of being \u201ctoo close to the victim\u201d. They leave without any fuss, as all federal agents do, I suppose. I\u2019m left feeling sick in the stomach before realising that a few hours had passed, leaving less time till her supposed death. \n\nI switch on the TV, but the broadcast shows nothing. I panic and switch to my phone, immediately turning to the internet denizens via Google Chrome. The moment the app is open, I am rerouted to a dodgy black website that only asks one question: \n\nARE YOU JOHN DOE?\n\n \u25a2YES  \u25a2NO\n\nI promptly check YES and find myself looking at my wife. This time, naked. She is still hanging by her wrists, though she seems to have regained consciousness. She silently mouths \u2018HELP\u2019 and looks at the floor, wildly gesturing with her eyes. As I follow her gaze, a sharp pain explodes through my body as I see the bruises on her body, especially around her midriff and d\u00e9colletage. My eyes tear up at the sight and clear just as quickly as the man enters.\n\nHe still seemed to be clad in his odd costume of a detective clown. His proximity, however, reveals the faded colours of the mask and the cracks in it. His sleeve seems to be slightly pulled back, revealing mottled yellow skin. He seems to have noticed my gaze and tugs it down to partly cover his glove once again. \u2018I said that I would give you 24 hours before I killed her, but I never said I wouldn\u2019t ravage her.\u2019 His words seem to spark an animalistic rage within me, adrenaline pouring through my veins as my mind begins to form horrible torture methods for this man. \n\nMy throat closes up as he stalks towards her, my blood boiling as he reaches his hand towards her, closing on her \u4e00\n\nHis gesture is cut off as I promptly close the app and open the Clock app to begin a 20-hour timer. I stare at the blinking lights of the timer as it goes off, it\u2019s every erratic flash like my heartbeat. I think of all the different ways I could track him down and decide to first take a look at my wife\u2019s workplace. \n\nI leave the house, starting my Toyota Corolla while cursing its slow speed. I drive to her work in a mad frenzy, my mind mentally counting the minutes it took me to reach the place. As I pull in, I am greeted by the security guard gesturing towards the gate, telling me to leave. In a rustic voice he says that my wife had left around 4 and a half hours ago. \n\nA quick check of the timer reveals that the man must have either picked her up and taken her to the place or kidnapped her one her way home, allowing 20 minutes for all of it to happen, give or take a few minutes. A map comes up in my mind, and I check the speed limit of the surrounding area. Most of the roads have a 60km/h speed limit while one road has a 100km/h speed limit. The highway seemed impossible as there was only one exit, and it was a half an hour\u2019s drive from here. After a quick preliminary elimination, I narrow it down to 3 roads: Hyde Lane, Chinatown, and Lincoln Street.\n\nFrom what me and my wife had seen of Chinatown, it seemed impossible that such a place could house a would-be murderer. The streets were too crowded and noisy, and the Chinese New Year\u2019s celebrations were too colourful to not have filtered into the room. It leaves me with two options: Hyde Lane and Lincoln Street. \n\nI make my way towards Lincoln Street, the street where my apartment was conveniently located. My phone suddenly dings, and two messages came from my wife\u2019s phone number. One of an image, and one text message, respectively. I unlock the phone with high hopes and read the message. QUICK, QUICK. I DON\u2019T THINK SHE CAN LAST MUCH LONGER. ;). The picture was of my wife, nude and battered. Her face didn\u2019t seem to be damaged, and neither did her limbs. All the bruises were at the midriff and chest. My heart begins to flutter, and I unlock the phone, going back to Google Chrome, expecting to see my wife, but greeted with the kidnapper\u2019s face instead. \u2018Keep your eyes on the road, Johnny Boy, we don\u2019t wanna ruin the fun too early now, do we?\u2019\n\nMy hands shake on the wheel, my grip growing increasingly unsteady as I realise that he might have seen me talking to the security guard, and possibly might have even heard me. I pull over, dazed, and confused, scared to drive in fear of a crash. My head spins as my gaze is stolen by the headlights of passing cars that disappear just as quickly over the horizon. My heart thunders in my chest as my mid registers a dark, limping figure clad in a coat walking towards me. As I lose feeling in my limbs, a stark whiteness comes over me, the only colourful thing I see, my wife\u2019s battered body.\n\n*Wake up, John*\n\n*Johnnnnny boy. Wake up. Wouldn\u2019t want to miss the fun, do you?*\n\n*J O H N!*\n\nI wake up, a bright light hanging over my head, blocking my view. From the corner of my eye, I spot the hooded figure, my body breaking out in a cold sweat as he nears me. As he gets closer, I realise it\u2019s the killer, this time my blood boils and a pump of adrenaline forces me to move my hands. They\u2019re strapped. I try to move my legs and chest instead, only to find them in the same state. I crane my neck to get a better view, only to once again be restrained by the straps. I lower my eyes as far as I can, and spot leather restraints over my wrists and ankles, my chest and waist constrained by the same contraption. I can feel cool, damp leather straps over my neck and head, pinning me down.\n\nI stifle a giggle at the absurdity of it all. My wife and I kidnapped and killed on the same day. I could picture the headlines: MAN GOES AFTER KIDNAPPED WIFE, ONLY TO DIE ALONGSIDE HER. I would have laughed aloud if my jaw wasn\u2019t clamped shut. The argument from the morning plays back in my head, like a grotesque version of a death song as my eyelids clamp shut.\n\n*\u201cWhy were you out the whole night?\u201d*\n\n*\u2018I can come and go whenever I wish, can\u2019t I? I am your wife, not some harlot that you have invited into your house.\u2019*\n\n*\u201cWhy did you go to Parker\u2019s house?\u2019*\n\n*\u2018I-I-I\u2026 I just passed by it that\u2019s all. I don\u2019t even know who and what you\u2019re talking about.\u2019*\n\n*\u201cLies, lies. I cannot believe you would cheat on me with that, that, that mongrel.\u201d*\n\n*\u2018I never slept with him and just to be clear, he is an exceptionally good man.\u2019*\n\n*\u201cI thought you said you said you had never heard of him before.\u2019\u2019*\n\n*\u201cBu-bu-but\u2026\u201d  (A sharp crack is heard in the blackness)*\n\nMy mind clears, and I see the man closer to me, a musky scent emanating from him, getting more intense the closer he gets. I suddenly realise that my wife is nowhere to be seen, my heart begins beating an erratic pattern once again. The man, clearly having seen my distress, speaks in a condescending voice. \u2018Don\u2019t worry. Your wife will be here soon enough.\u2019\n\nMy heart lurches at that. I think that my wife is safe, but the hours spent reading mystery books tells my mind otherwise. I calculate different ways to escape, the various routes and potential weapons flooding my mind as my heart begins to flutter once more. \u2018Be careful, Parker. Don\u2019t taunt him too much. His heart condition will flare up again and he will end too soon. We don\u2019t want that now, do we?\u2019 Her voice floats from the other side of the room, cold and razor sharp, like a king giving the execution grant. As he turns to face her, I spot a line on his neck that separated very fair skin and mottled yellow skin. I realise that it is makeup, and that the clown mask isn\u2019t really a mask, but more of a face painting. \n\nI dare a look at my wife, resplendent in her gown and make-up. A question keeps playing in my head, *Why?* I couldn\u2019t understand why she could do this, why she would team up with that no-good Parker. As I black out once again, I hear the voices of Parker and my wife as they rush toward me. \n\n*\u201cI don\u2019t want to see you near me and my wife again.\u201d*\n\n*\u2018But I am your friend, John. Have been for the past few years now. Surely a minor accident couldn\u2019t have changed that. Surely, I am worth more than my face and arms.\u2019*\n\n*\u201cLook at you, Park. You don\u2019t even look like a man anymore. I don\u2019t want any of my future children to think I am friends with idiots such as you!\u201d*\n\n*\u2018John, livedo reticularis is not something that I can get. It was apparently genetic. I can\u2019t change that, can I now John? Even your children could ha\u2014\u2019*\n\nI snap awake and immediately regret it. Parker\u2019s mask is washed-off and the bluish-veins on his face stand out in the pale, white light. I don\u2019t pay attention to my wife, fearing that I may feel sympathy for her even though she seems to be the mastermind behind it all. I sneak a glance anyway, and I see their hands clasped together, grinning at me sadistically in unison. My heart sinks and my mind seems to retreat into the deepest recess of my brain.\n\nI seem to be viewing the world through a pair of binoculars. I spot a metal plate next to my bed, filled with wickedly sharp surgical instruments. In this dark recess, I seem to feel no fear or pain, withdrawn as I am. My mind prepares for pain of the scalpel as Parker and she lift the scalpel and plier, respectively. I seem to have already been betrayed by whom I have regarded as the closest to me. Surely, no pain could be greater than that. *Why didn\u2019t I just kill her when I had the chance?*",

I could picture the headlines: MAN GOES AFTER KIDNAPPED WIFE, ONLY TO DIE ALONGSIDE HER. I would have laughed aloud if my jaw wasn\u2019t clamped shut. The argument from the morning plays back in my head, like a grotesque version of a death song as my eyelids clamp shut.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;\u201cWhy were you out the whole night?\u201d&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;\u2018I can come and go whenever I wish, can\u2019t I? I am your wife, not some harlot that you have invited into your house.\u2019&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;\u201cWhy did you go to Parker\u2019s house?\u2019&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;\u2018I-I-I\u2026 I just passed by it that\u2019s all. I don\u2019t even know who and what you\u2019re talking about.\u2019&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;\u201cLies, lies. I cannot believe you would cheat on me with that, that, that mongrel.\u201d&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;\u2018I never slept with him and just to be clear, he is an exceptionally good man.\u2019&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;\u201cI thought you said you said you had never heard of him before.\u2019\u2019&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;\u201cBu-bu-but\u2026\u201d  (A sharp crack is heard in the blackness)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My mind clears, and I see the man closer to me, a musky scent emanating from him, getting more intense the closer he gets. I suddenly realise that my wife is nowhere to be seen, my heart begins beating an erratic pattern once again. The man, clearly having seen my distress, speaks in a condescending voice. \u2018Don\u2019t worry. Your wife will be here soon enough.\u2019&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My heart lurches at that. I think that my wife is safe, but the hours spent reading mystery books tells my mind otherwise. I calculate different ways to escape, the various routes and potential weapons flooding my mind as my heart begins to flutter once more. \u2018Be careful, Parker. Don\u2019t taunt him too much. His heart condition will flare up again and he will end too soon. We don\u2019t want that now, do we?\u2019 Her voice floats from the other side of the room, cold and razor sharp, like a king giving the execution grant. As he turns to face her, I spot a line on his neck that separated very fair skin and mottled yellow skin. I realise that it is makeup, and that the clown mask isn\u2019t really a mask, but more of a face painting. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I dare a look at my wife, resplendent in her gown and make-up. A question keeps playing in my head, &lt;em&gt;Why?&lt;/em&gt; I couldn\u2019t understand why she could do this, why she would team up with that no-good Parker. As I black out once again, I hear the voices of Parker and my wife as they rush toward me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;\u201cI don\u2019t want to see you near me and my wife again.\u201d&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;\u2018But I am your friend, John. Have been for the past few years now. Surely a minor accident couldn\u2019t have changed that. Surely, I am worth more than my face and arms.\u2019&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;\u201cLook at you, Park. You don\u2019t even look like a man anymore. I don\u2019t want any of my future children to think I am friends with idiots such as you!\u201d&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;\u2018John, livedo reticularis is not something that I can get. It was apparently genetic. I can\u2019t change that, can I now John? Even your children could ha\u2014\u2019&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I snap awake and immediately regret it. Parker\u2019s mask is washed-off and the bluish-veins on his face stand out in the pale, white light. I don\u2019t pay attention to my wife, fearing that I may feel sympathy for her even though she seems to be the mastermind behind it all. I sneak a glance anyway, and I see their hands clasped together, grinning at me sadistically in unison. My heart sinks and my mind seems to retreat into the deepest recess of my brain.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I seem to be viewing the world through a pair of binoculars. I spot a metal plate next to my bed, filled with wickedly sharp surgical instruments. In this dark recess, I seem to feel no fear or pain, withdrawn as I am. My mind prepares for pain of the scalpel as Parker and she lift the scalpel and plier, respectively. I seem to have already been betrayed by whom I have regarded as the closest to me. Surely, no pain could be greater than that. &lt;em&gt;Why didn\u2019t I just kill her when I had the chance?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
