A large rug with a turquoise pattern partially covers the hardwood floors. The room is very bright, too bright, too perky for a day like this. I scan my surroundings once more, and I set down my messenger bag and leather backpack. I nod without speaking.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Good. If you need me, you can come up at anytime.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCorrine closes the door with a soft *click*. Her footsteps fade away, and I sit down on the bed. Silent tears prickle at my eyes, and begin to roll down my face, fogging up my glasses. I was angry. Angry at myself, the world, and Corrine and Timothy Martich's picture-perfect life, with their three kids and huge house. How did I end up with them? I thought I would have been sent \u0014to live with Kerri Vale or Sofie Miyazaki's family, not with my middle-school shop teacher's family. He wasn't a bad person, I just did not like him as a teacher or his class. They were your typical bougie, upper middle class family in an affluent neighborhood. They lived in a house with six bedrooms and 4.5 bathrooms, 5,000 square feet. They had a house in Maine, owned a boat, and Corrine had several Louis Vuitton bags. These weren't my people. My mom would have referred to Corrine as \"one of those Westport moms\", referencing *American Housewife.* I mean, yeah, we did have a boat, but it was a fishing boat, and it wasn't ours anymore, since my parents and brother were gone. I read through the last text I got from my mom, mentioning how they were going to Ben &amp; Jerry's after the baseball game, and asked me what I wanted. I said vanilla. I don't think I'll ever be able to eat anything flavored vanilla after that. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was snapped out of my thoughts by the door opening. Corrine is standing in the doorway.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Dinner is ready, do you want some?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"I'm not hungry.\" I mumble, keeping my eyes downcast. She nods and closes the door. I unzip my bag and take out my laptop, which I received as a Christmas gift last year. I also remove my main-gauche from the backpack. The main-gauche was one of my most prized possessions. It was a fine parrying dagger, almost as long as my arm, and simple in its decoration. I unsheathed it from the leather scabbard and looked at the sheen of the blade. I had purchased it at a Renaissance Faire in September. I probably would never go to one again. I touch the tip of the blade with the pad of my index finger. It was sharp. Suddenly, the unthinkable crossed my mind, what I should do with the dagger. I didn't like the Martichs. Why should I have to deal with them?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDeeply unsettled by my thought, I sheathed the dagger and placed it back in my backpack gently. Better to not let Corrine see it. I threw myself on the bed and stared at the ceiling. I looked at the clock. It was 6:58 PM. Normally, at this time, I would be goofing around at my art class, with my weeaboo and metalhead friends. That was gone also.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMost, if all, of my original life had been left behind. I was to become a bougie, basic bitch like everyone else. I scraped my fingernail on the bedspread angrily. I decided I would close my eyes and wait for sleep to take hold.",
