To be honest she doesn't know I'm posting this. She is very kind and Hubble and doesn't want admit her writing is really good. (mind you she's 14 and i'm 15). She hasn't finished editing this so if there are any errors its my fault not hers.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nScratches. Scissors. Mirror. Food. Disappointment. Broken.\n\nBy: Hannah\n\nThe day was like any other Friday morning in the middle of November, the grass was frosted over, and it was cold. I woke up that day and got ready how I usually did. At 6:50 in the morning my alarm goes off and I wake up. I would normally go back to sleep after I shut off that alarm but I forgot to shower the night before, so I got up to get my clothes. Thankfully, I was smart enough to set out my outfit for today before bed last night. As I pick up my clothes I stubbed my toe on the sliding rail for my closet doors. I dropped the F bomb. Something a 12 year old probably shouldn't have done.\n\n\u201cShoot, I hope my parents didn\u2019t hear that.\u201d I thought to myself after the pain went away. The walls in my house are very thin and my room is next to theirs.\n\nI walk over to my door and open it the rest of the way. As I do, I see my dogs glowing eyes reflecting the living room lights.\n\n\u201cWell that\u2019s not creepy, Lucky.\u201d I whispered and bent down to scratch him behind the ear. As I moved around him, I turned on the bathroom light and shut the door.\n\nI set my clothes on the counter next to the sink and brush my hair before getting into the shower. While in the shower I of course get soap in my left eye. Another F bomb was dropped. After frantically washing my eye out with water and washing my body, I turn off the shower and open the curtain. I reach for my towel that was hanging up on a rack next to the shower and dry off. Above the towel rack there is a clock and I squint to try and read the time, 7:05.\n\n\u201cGreat, I spent about 10 minutes in the shower because of my eye. I could have used those five extra minutes to watch Netflix or something.\u201d I thought and step onto the shower mat outside of the tub.\n\nAfter getting dressed and brushing my hair I open the bathroom door and walk out into the hallway, turning off the light behind me. I then walk down the hall and to the left where my bedroom is. I feel the wall to try and find the lightswitch because it was still dark outside. I flip it on after trying to find it for what seemed like forever, and put my night clothes into the laundry basket behind my door. I then walked like a zombie to my bed and unplug my phone.\n\n\u201c7:10, time to eat.\u201d I said and unlocked my phone. I then open Snapchat and send my streaks and open all my texts from last night after I fell asleep and this morning. I saw that Desi texted me;\n\n\u201cCan you bring me perfume please?\u201d\n\nI rolled my eyes and texted her back;\n\n\u201cSure, I\u2019ll also bring you a poptart.\u201d and hit send. Desi and I met my second school year in Ohio. The first month of 5th grade I didn't really know who I was and lost myself. Desi and I didn't get along at first, but after I found who I was we became good friends.\n\nI walked back out of my room and down the hall, Lucy, my other dog jumped off my parents bed then and followed me. I turned on the kitchen light and off the living room one. I next walk over to the cabinet where we keep our room temperature foods stored. Choosing the kind of cereal I wanted that day was easy. I hated Wheaties and the only other cereal that appealed to me there was Cheerios. I pick up the box and get a bowl from the a cabinet to the left of the sink. After pouring out the cereal and getting the milk I realized that I had a History test that day, great. I unhappily pour the milk into my bowl and  put the milk back in the fridge.  I got a spoon from the drawer under the microwave counter and sat down at the dinner table.\n\n\u201cWhy is it called a \u2018dinner table\u2019 if we eat a variety of meals here throughout the day and not just dinner?\u201d I thought  to myself as I dreadfully started to shovel my breakfast down. I pick up my phone that I set down on  the table and turn it on. 7:20.\n\nI then set an alarm for 7:50 on my phone and open Netflix to watch something while I ate. I have a bad habit of watching seven shows at once so I spent a few minutes trying to decide on what to watch. After some thought I clicked on \u201cThe Flash\u201d and finished the rest of the episode I was watching the night before. I had just enough time to finish the episode when my alarm went off. I got up and rinsed out my cereal bowl and put it in the dishwasher. While doing this I remembered the time I put Dawn dish soap in the dishwasher since we ran out of actual dishwasher soap. It overfload and there was soap all over the kitchen, coming out from all sides of the machine. I laugh to myself and walk down the hall and back to my room.\n\nI gather my school things and put them into my bag along with my perfume that smells like roses for Desi. Next I put on my socks and shoes then find a hoodie to wear. I have a thing about hoodies. I wear one almost every single day of the school year. They keep me warm and are just comforting in an emotional way. I pick one that\u2019s black with white lettering that reads \u201cJust Do You\u201d . It\u2019s already cold outside, I can feel it in the house. I look at the time again and it reads 7:55. I walk down the hallway and into the bathroom to brush my teeth. At first when I spit out the toothpaste I panicked, I quickly realized the scent and sight of blood was from me brushing my gums too roughly. I hate the smell of blood, it smells like rusting iron and mold. It makes me nauseous. I set down my tooth brush and wrap one arm around my stomach and use my other hand to cling to the edge of the sink.\n\n\u201cJust breathe and count to ten.\u201d I tell myself and after a few minutes I collect myself and feel better. I then pick up my phone and look at the time. \u201c8:05. Shit.\u201d\n\nI quickly throw my toothbrush back into the cabinet above the sink and walk out of the bathroom with my phone. I throw on my backpack on and walk to the end of the hall, to the door. I unlock it with a \u201cclink\u201d and open the door. The cold breeze of November breathes into my warm house. The smell of frost and snow make their way into my home. I close my eyes and breathe it in for a second. In that second everything else that was on my mind goes away.\n\nThat's the thing about nature with me. Whenever I look out of a window or smell the fresh air, my mind goes blank. It's the only time I'm not worrying about anyone or anything. It's enlightening in a way. A cat's paws hit the ground and makes a soft \u201cthud\u201d as it hits the snow. Cats love to sit on the wall outside of my house this time of year. I sigh and step outside, closing the door behind me. I look to the left and my moms car is in the driveway still.\n\n\u201cShe's going to be late again if she doesn't get up soon.\u201d I think to myself as the cat from before walks up to me. It\u2019s green eyes stare back at me as it rubs its jet black fur against my leg. I get my gloves from my backpack and put them on before I pet the cat. It purrs as I rub behind its ears for a while.\n\n\u201cHannah!\u201d I hear an all too familiar voice call out from a distance. Desi. I look up and she\u2019s waving me over from her house. Her hair is wet again and I recall all the times me and her would run into her house in the winter so our hair wouldn't freeze in the cold. I smile to myself on the thought and start to walk over to her. The cat follows me as I cross the road.\n\n\u201cHi, you might want to get into your house before your hair freezes again.\u201d I laugh and walk back with her to her house. Desi is the type of girl who\u2019s friends with a lot of people. Some of the people I don't particularly like, but she's a good person. I swear she eats drama for breakfast sometimes though.\n\n\u201cI have it in a bun, but you\u2019re right. It is kinda cold out and we both know I don't know what a coat is in the weather so let's go inside. The bus should be here in like 5 minutes.\u201d She replied and opened the door.\n\n\u201cDang Desi, do you not use a heater? It\u2019s colder in here then it is outside!\u201d I complain as I step into her house and prepare to be attacked by her dogs.\n\n\u201cThe dogs are in with my mom. We do use a heater but believe it or not it's actually warmer in here by one degree.\u201d Desi teases and sits down on her steps.\n\nShe tells me about some more drama between her and this girl I\u2019ve never met before. I told you she eats it for breakfast. The bus turns the corner then and we see it in her door window.\n\n\u201cOh thank goodness, the bus is here.\u201d I breathe and Desi laughs. She knows I don\u2019t care about the latest scandal in school.\n\nWe walk out of her house and into the cold again. She was right, her house is warmer then it is out here. We walk a few steps to the stop sign which is the bus stop and get onto the bus once it stops.\n\nThe smell of leather hits me as I step onto the bus and take my seat. Desi walks to the back where all of her friends who I don\u2019t like very much sit. We are the first ones on the bus in the morning so its quiet. I look out the window and lose track of time. My friend, Lea sits down next to me then.\n\n\u201cAre you okay dude, you look kinda depressed?\u201d She asks and sets her bag in her lap. Lea\u2019s the kind of person I can live with if I wanted to. We have a lot in common and like the same people. We mostly talk about some reality youtubers like Shane Dawson who is our favorite. Sometimes we talk about how we used to like anime and cringe at the fact that we went through that faze.\n\n\u201cYeah im okay.\u201d I reply, \u201cI just zoned out again I guess. How was your night?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was okay. I fell asleep at 7 again and didn't wake up until my alarm went off at 7:30. So I got a full 12 and a half hours of sleep. We both know I needed it though, I dont usually sleep much.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d I laugh. \u201cYou sure did get a lot more sleep then I did though. I didn't fall asleep until close to 4 this morning. I haven\u2019t been sleeping well again.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you think it\u2019s because of your gut feelings you've been getting recently?\u201d Lea asks as we turn the corner to the school.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, maybe.\u201d I say and think about the feelings I\u2019ve been getting again.\n\nMy mother, sister, father, grandma, and some more of my relatives all have seen some dead relatives. They don\u2019t look scary, but they see them in places like the coseno or their old house walking to the bathroom. I personally haven\u2019t seen anything like this before but I do get these feelings and visions in a way, like my dad. In the back of my mind throughout the day I see visions but I don't notice them until they happen. It\u2019s like the case of deja vu\u2019 but I\u2019ve seen the event happen before in my head. I don\u2019t understand why and it confuses me, but my dad gets the same thing sometimes.\n\nI also get these gut feelings when it comes to my sister or other important people in my life. I get the feeling in the pit of my stomach and my chest that something may happen soon. Whenever I get this feeling something does happen that day, three days later, or even a week later. I mostly get this feeling and then something happens with my sister. Sometimes though, something happens to my other family members like my grandma for instance. Once I got this gut feeling about my grandma and two days later she tripped and hurt her ankle while walking down the stairs.\n\nWe pull into the school parking lot then and into the bus lane.\n\n\u201cTime for prison.\u201d I joked and got off the bus which was now loud with verious chatter.\n\nWalking into school I hear the bell ring and the sound of people opening and shutting their lockers. I walk up the stairs located in the main lobby and to mine. Both people who are next to me just left to walk to homeroom so I have more space. The lockers at my school are small. Some are the size of an old square box t.v but mine is probably the size of a tall and thin cd rack. I get out my locker key from my backpack and unlock my locker. I cannot work a combination lock to save my life. I open my locker and stuff my bag into it as best as I could. I then open the cubby at the top of it by flicking a little metal bar inside of the main part of the locker. I grab my notebooks for science, history, and english, along with my pencil bag and book. I was reading \u201cThe Tale of Despereaux\u201d for the hundredth time. Something about the book just speaks to me, maybe it\u2019s the happy ending.\n\nI close my both parts of my locker and start to walk to homeroom. I work my way down the hall, down the stairs, and to the right where Mrs.Gill greats me.\n\n\u201cGood morning!\u201d She smiles and I smile in agnolishment. Mrs.Gill is nice and can make homeroom and first period fun sometimes. Homeroom and first period went was dragged on like always. All I usually do is sit there and read. After an hour and a half a book can get a bit boring if you don't take breaks. Mrs.Gill didn\u2019t have anything fun to show us that day so nothing important happened. I pretty much finished my book before the bell rang for second period.\n\nThat\u2019s when it started to happen. As I walked down the halls, I started to notice how pretty everyone is, even on a day like Monday.\n\n\u201cWow, I\u2019m really not all that good looking.\u201d I thought to myself for what seemed like the tenth time in my life. Everyone has days where they don\u2019t feel good about themselves, but this day was the first day I took it in deep.\n\nThat\u2019s all I thought about for the rest of the day. Second period went by like a blur, Ms.Hobz just had us do book work for our upcoming science test that Friday. I didn\u2019t eat lunch that day, I just took it out of my bag and threw it away. Food disgusted me.\n\n\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you eating anything, Hannah?\u201d My friend Abbi asked me.\n\n\u201cNot hungry.\u201d I said and just lied my head down. I was.\n\nAbbi was one of my closest friends at the time. We could write a paragraph about what one of us were thinking about just by looking at each others faces. She was always there for me, but she also has self-confidence issues so I didn't bring up mine with her. I knew better than to talk about my issues with her. She always found a way to make them about herself.\n\nFourth period rolled around and that\u2019s when I\u2019d almost always fall asleep. I can\u2019t help that no one talks so it\u2019s always quiet in my History class. My teacher, Mrs.John hated it, but it was nice to have a relaxing class. I like history, it\u2019s an easier subject to learn unlike science and math. I got called on twice to answer questions, I hate being called on. The spotlight is not for me. I luckily knew the answers to both questions. I usually do, I just don\u2019t want to answer.\n\nFifth period had my favorite teacher, Mr.Scall. He was my english teacher and always nagged me about not writing enough. He still does to this day. I can be walking down the hall to third period and he\u2019ll stop me and say,\n\n\u201cHannah! You don\u2019t write enough.\u201d\n\nI\u2019d say something along the lines of \u201cYes, I know Mr.Scall.\u201d and walk to third.\n\nThat day we were presenting our monologues to the class. Me and my friend Natasha decided to to act out a skit about *Shark Tank*. Our prop was a zombie toy and I was one of the sharks. Natasha was presenting her item (the toy) to me and in the end, after we made the deal she said it was a fake. The class loved our act, but I still hate presenting things to this day.\n\nSixth period came and I walked to math class with Ms.Po. Sixth period was the only class I absolutely hated. The people there were always so wound up and always gave Ms.Po a hard time. There were only six people  in the class out of 15 that she actually could rely on to complete the work. Me of course, being one of them. People always say I throw myself into my work, it\u2019s true. It keeps me from thinking bad about myself.\n\nThankfully, sixth period went by fast and the bell rang. I walked to my locker and looked at the ground for the most part. I didn\u2019t want to see anyone\u2019s pretty faces again. I unlock my locker and open the cubby at the top again to put my books in it. I then grab my backpack and check my phone. Five miss calls from mom.\n\n\u201cGreat.\u201d I say to myself as the people beside me open their lockers.\n\nI put my phone in my hoodie pocket and put on my backpack straps. I next shut my locker and walked down the hall to my friend Alanna\u2019s locker.\n\nAlanna is my second best friend. I honestly like her more than Abbi for some pretty obvious reasons. She\u2019s more humble and Abbi always tried so hard to make everything about her. Alanna on the other hand, doesn\u2019t talk about herself enough. I worry about her. She always had her blonde hair up in a bun or a ponytail. She mostly wears hoodies, like me and sweatpants. We both prefer to be comfortable over stylish.\n\n\u201cHey.\u201d\n\n\u201cHey.\u201d She replies and shuts her locker. We walk down the hall and down the stairs to exit the school building.\n\n\u201cHow was your day?\u201d I asked as we walked over to the tree in the front of the building to wait for our rides to get there. The grounds in front of the building look so much bigger when there are people on almost every inch of it. Great, more pretty faces to look at.\n\n\u201cIt was good. Ms.Hob\u2019s class was fun.\u201d Alanna replies. She starts to talk about what they did but I wasn\u2019t paying attention. That\u2019s when I saw him. He was standing just a few feet in front of me talking to some of the people who ride my bus. I didn\u2019t recognize him until now but, he rides my bus too. For a second it seemed like time had frozen. Everything around me that was still, it\u2019s like the Earth shifted and everything that needed to be balanced, was.\n\n\u201cHannah?\u201d A distant voice calls and it snaps me back to reality.\n\n\u201cHannah! Your bus is here! Hello?\u201d Alanna shouts and I blink at her blakely. I look at her and back at him getting on the bus and I swear I could see him smiling and shaking his head at me.\n\n\u201cWhat is this witchcraft?\u201d I laugh to myself.\n\n\u201cUm, what?\u201d Alanna asks confused. \u201cNevermind, just get on the bus before it leaves you behind.\u201d\n\nI turned and started walking to my bus, in what seemed like autopilot.  I couldn\u2019t think straight as I sat down next to Lea on the bus.\n\n\u201cDude, what happened? You look actually shooketh.\u201d  Lea asks, concerned.\n\n\u201cNothing.\u201d I assure all to quickly, even for me. \u201c I um\u2026 I\u2019ll text you later about it,\u201d I say trying to recover from my quick reply.\n\n\u201cOkay?\u201d Lea says and puts in her ear buds to listen to music.\n\nI did the same and halfway through the bus ride home, I open my eyes that where apparently closed. A reaction to his voice I heard yelling out of one of the bus windows.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re smoking cancer sticks!\u201d He calls out to people who are walking down the sidewalks.\n\nI smile and shake my head. \u201cWhat is his name?\u201d\n\n\u201cJacob!\u201d Mr.Jo calls, \u201cSit down and cut that out before you cause me to crash this bus.\u201d\n\n\u201cJacob.\u201d I think to myself, smiling as I shake my head.\n\n\u201cOh, you wouldn\u2019t do that Mr.Jo!\u201d Jacob replies smiling, as he shuts the window and heads back to his seat.\n\nI can\u2019t help but listen to the conversations on the bus the rest of the ride home. Almost everyone had gotten off the bus by the time I put my earbuds away.\n\n\u201cBye Lea.\u201d I say as I move out of her way so she can get off of the bus.\n\n\u201cBye, my dude.\u201d She calls back and starts to walk home.\n\nEveryone who sits in the back of the bus then moves up to the front for the last two stops. The bus driver turns the corner to mine and Desi\u2019s bus stop and we stand up to get off.\n\n\u201cBye Desi, bye Hannah.\u201d Jacob says as we walk off the bus.\n\n\u201cBye.\u201d Desi laughs and starts to walk home.\n\nI couldn\u2019t say anything back. I was afraid I\u2019d choke if I tried.\n\n\u201cHow does he know my name?\u201d I  whisper to myself as I walk home on the sidewalk. I look up to see my dogs in the window wagging their tails. They start to bark as I open the mailbox to get the mail.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks aging for reading this. ",

This story is pt 1 in a series my girlfriend Hannah has written. To be honest she doesn&amp;#39;t know I&amp;#39;m posting this. She is very kind and Hubble and doesn&amp;#39;t want admit her writing is really good. (mind you she&amp;#39;s 14 and i&amp;#39;m 15). She hasn&amp;#39;t finished editing this so if there are any errors its my fault not hers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Scratches. Scissors. Mirror. Food. Disappointment. Broken.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By: Hannah&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The day was like any other Friday morning in the middle of November, the grass was frosted over, and it was cold. I woke up that day and got ready how I usually did. At 6:50 in the morning my alarm goes off and I wake up. I would normally go back to sleep after I shut off that alarm but I forgot to shower the night before, so I got up to get my clothes. Thankfully, I was smart enough to set out my outfit for today before bed last night. As I pick up my clothes I stubbed my toe on the sliding rail for my closet doors. I dropped the F bomb. Something a 12 year old probably shouldn&amp;#39;t have done.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cShoot, I hope my parents didn\u2019t hear that.\u201d I thought to myself after the pain went away. The walls in my house are very thin and my room is next to theirs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I walk over to my door and open it the rest of the way. As I do, I see my dogs glowing eyes reflecting the living room lights.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWell that\u2019s not creepy, Lucky.\u201d I whispered and bent down to scratch him behind the ear. As I moved around him, I turned on the bathroom light and shut the door.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I set my clothes on the counter next to the sink and brush my hair before getting into the shower. While in the shower I of course get soap in my left eye. Another F bomb was dropped. After frantically washing my eye out with water and washing my body, I turn off the shower and open the curtain. I reach for my towel that was hanging up on a rack next to the shower and dry off. Above the towel rack there is a clock and I squint to try and read the time, 7:05.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cGreat, I spent about 10 minutes in the shower because of my eye. I could have used those five extra minutes to watch Netflix or something.\u201d I thought and step onto the shower mat outside of the tub.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After getting dressed and brushing my hair I open the bathroom door and walk out into the hallway, turning off the light behind me. I then walk down the hall and to the left where my bedroom is. I feel the wall to try and find the lightswitch because it was still dark outside. I flip it on after trying to find it for what seemed like forever, and put my night clothes into the laundry basket behind my door. I then walked like a zombie to my bed and unplug my phone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201c7:10, time to eat.\u201d I said and unlocked my phone. I then open Snapchat and send my streaks and open all my texts from last night after I fell asleep and this morning. I saw that Desi texted me;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cCan you bring me perfume please?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I rolled my eyes and texted her back;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cSure, I\u2019ll also bring you a poptart.\u201d and hit send. Desi and I met my second school year in Ohio. The first month of 5th grade I didn&amp;#39;t really know who I was and lost myself. Desi and I didn&amp;#39;t get along at first, but after I found who I was we became good friends.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I walked back out of my room and down the hall, Lucy, my other dog jumped off my parents bed then and followed me. I turned on the kitchen light and off the living room one. I next walk over to the cabinet where we keep our room temperature foods stored. Choosing the kind of cereal I wanted that day was easy. I hated Wheaties and the only other cereal that appealed to me there was Cheerios. I pick up the box and get a bowl from the a cabinet to the left of the sink. After pouring out the cereal and getting the milk I realized that I had a History test that day, great. I unhappily pour the milk into my bowl and  put the milk back in the fridge.  I got a spoon from the drawer under the microwave counter and sat down at the dinner table.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWhy is it called a \u2018dinner table\u2019 if we eat a variety of meals here throughout the day and not just dinner?\u201d I thought  to myself as I dreadfully started to shovel my breakfast down. I pick up my phone that I set down on  the table and turn it on. 7:20.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I then set an alarm for 7:50 on my phone and open Netflix to watch something while I ate. I have a bad habit of watching seven shows at once so I spent a few minutes trying to decide on what to watch. After some thought I clicked on \u201cThe Flash\u201d and finished the rest of the episode I was watching the night before. I had just enough time to finish the episode when my alarm went off. I got up and rinsed out my cereal bowl and put it in the dishwasher. While doing this I remembered the time I put Dawn dish soap in the dishwasher since we ran out of actual dishwasher soap. It overfload and there was soap all over the kitchen, coming out from all sides of the machine. I laugh to myself and walk down the hall and back to my room.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I gather my school things and put them into my bag along with my perfume that smells like roses for Desi. Next I put on my socks and shoes then find a hoodie to wear. I have a thing about hoodies. I wear one almost every single day of the school year. They keep me warm and are just comforting in an emotional way. I pick one that\u2019s black with white lettering that reads \u201cJust Do You\u201d . It\u2019s already cold outside, I can feel it in the house. I look at the time again and it reads 7:55. I walk down the hallway and into the bathroom to brush my teeth. At first when I spit out the toothpaste I panicked, I quickly realized the scent and sight of blood was from me brushing my gums too roughly. I hate the smell of blood, it smells like rusting iron and mold. It makes me nauseous. I set down my tooth brush and wrap one arm around my stomach and use my other hand to cling to the edge of the sink.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cJust breathe and count to ten.\u201d I tell myself and after a few minutes I collect myself and feel better. I then pick up my phone and look at the time. \u201c8:05. Shit.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I quickly throw my toothbrush back into the cabinet above the sink and walk out of the bathroom with my phone. I throw on my backpack on and walk to the end of the hall, to the door. I unlock it with a \u201cclink\u201d and open the door. The cold breeze of November breathes into my warm house. The smell of frost and snow make their way into my home. I close my eyes and breathe it in for a second. In that second everything else that was on my mind goes away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s the thing about nature with me. Whenever I look out of a window or smell the fresh air, my mind goes blank. It&amp;#39;s the only time I&amp;#39;m not worrying about anyone or anything. It&amp;#39;s enlightening in a way. A cat&amp;#39;s paws hit the ground and makes a soft \u201cthud\u201d as it hits the snow. Cats love to sit on the wall outside of my house this time of year. I sigh and step outside, closing the door behind me. I look to the left and my moms car is in the driveway still.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cShe&amp;#39;s going to be late again if she doesn&amp;#39;t get up soon.\u201d I think to myself as the cat from before walks up to me. It\u2019s green eyes stare back at me as it rubs its jet black fur against my leg. I get my gloves from my backpack and put them on before I pet the cat. It purrs as I rub behind its ears for a while.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cHannah!\u201d I hear an all too familiar voice call out from a distance. Desi. I look up and she\u2019s waving me over from her house. Her hair is wet again and I recall all the times me and her would run into her house in the winter so our hair wouldn&amp;#39;t freeze in the cold. I smile to myself on the thought and start to walk over to her. The cat follows me as I cross the road.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cHi, you might want to get into your house before your hair freezes again.\u201d I laugh and walk back with her to her house. Desi is the type of girl who\u2019s friends with a lot of people. Some of the people I don&amp;#39;t particularly like, but she&amp;#39;s a good person. I swear she eats drama for breakfast sometimes though.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI have it in a bun, but you\u2019re right. It is kinda cold out and we both know I don&amp;#39;t know what a coat is in the weather so let&amp;#39;s go inside. The bus should be here in like 5 minutes.\u201d She replied and opened the door.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cDang Desi, do you not use a heater? It\u2019s colder in here then it is outside!\u201d I complain as I step into her house and prepare to be attacked by her dogs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cThe dogs are in with my mom. We do use a heater but believe it or not it&amp;#39;s actually warmer in here by one degree.\u201d Desi teases and sits down on her steps.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She tells me about some more drama between her and this girl I\u2019ve never met before. I told you she eats it for breakfast. The bus turns the corner then and we see it in her door window.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cOh thank goodness, the bus is here.\u201d I breathe and Desi laughs. She knows I don\u2019t care about the latest scandal in school.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We walk out of her house and into the cold again. She was right, her house is warmer then it is out here. We walk a few steps to the stop sign which is the bus stop and get onto the bus once it stops.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The smell of leather hits me as I step onto the bus and take my seat. Desi walks to the back where all of her friends who I don\u2019t like very much sit. We are the first ones on the bus in the morning so its quiet. I look out the window and lose track of time. My friend, Lea sits down next to me then.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cAre you okay dude, you look kinda depressed?\u201d She asks and sets her bag in her lap. Lea\u2019s the kind of person I can live with if I wanted to. We have a lot in common and like the same people. We mostly talk about some reality youtubers like Shane Dawson who is our favorite. Sometimes we talk about how we used to like anime and cringe at the fact that we went through that faze.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cYeah im okay.\u201d I reply, \u201cI just zoned out again I guess. How was your night?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cIt was okay. I fell asleep at 7 again and didn&amp;#39;t wake up until my alarm went off at 7:30. So I got a full 12 and a half hours of sleep. We both know I needed it though, I dont usually sleep much.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cYeah,\u201d I laugh. \u201cYou sure did get a lot more sleep then I did though. I didn&amp;#39;t fall asleep until close to 4 this morning. I haven\u2019t been sleeping well again.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cDo you think it\u2019s because of your gut feelings you&amp;#39;ve been getting recently?\u201d Lea asks as we turn the corner to the school.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI don\u2019t know, maybe.\u201d I say and think about the feelings I\u2019ve been getting again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My mother, sister, father, grandma, and some more of my relatives all have seen some dead relatives. They don\u2019t look scary, but they see them in places like the coseno or their old house walking to the bathroom. I personally haven\u2019t seen anything like this before but I do get these feelings and visions in a way, like my dad. In the back of my mind throughout the day I see visions but I don&amp;#39;t notice them until they happen. It\u2019s like the case of deja vu\u2019 but I\u2019ve seen the event happen before in my head. I don\u2019t understand why and it confuses me, but my dad gets the same thing sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also get these gut feelings when it comes to my sister or other important people in my life. I get the feeling in the pit of my stomach and my chest that something may happen soon. Whenever I get this feeling something does happen that day, three days later, or even a week later. I mostly get this feeling and then something happens with my sister. Sometimes though, something happens to my other family members like my grandma for instance. Once I got this gut feeling about my grandma and two days later she tripped and hurt her ankle while walking down the stairs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We pull into the school parking lot then and into the bus lane.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cTime for prison.\u201d I joked and got off the bus which was now loud with verious chatter.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Walking into school I hear the bell ring and the sound of people opening and shutting their lockers. I walk up the stairs located in the main lobby and to mine. Both people who are next to me just left to walk to homeroom so I have more space. The lockers at my school are small. Some are the size of an old square box t.v but mine is probably the size of a tall and thin cd rack. I get out my locker key from my backpack and unlock my locker. I cannot work a combination lock to save my life. I open my locker and stuff my bag into it as best as I could. I then open the cubby at the top of it by flicking a little metal bar inside of the main part of the locker. I grab my notebooks for science, history, and english, along with my pencil bag and book. I was reading \u201cThe Tale of Despereaux\u201d for the hundredth time. Something about the book just speaks to me, maybe it\u2019s the happy ending.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I close my both parts of my locker and start to walk to homeroom. I work my way down the hall, down the stairs, and to the right where Mrs.Gill greats me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cGood morning!\u201d She smiles and I smile in agnolishment. Mrs.Gill is nice and can make homeroom and first period fun sometimes. Homeroom and first period went was dragged on like always. All I usually do is sit there and read. After an hour and a half a book can get a bit boring if you don&amp;#39;t take breaks. Mrs.Gill didn\u2019t have anything fun to show us that day so nothing important happened. I pretty much finished my book before the bell rang for second period.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That\u2019s when it started to happen. As I walked down the halls, I started to notice how pretty everyone is, even on a day like Monday.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWow, I\u2019m really not all that good looking.\u201d I thought to myself for what seemed like the tenth time in my life. Everyone has days where they don\u2019t feel good about themselves, but this day was the first day I took it in deep.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That\u2019s all I thought about for the rest of the day. Second period went by like a blur, Ms.Hobz just had us do book work for our upcoming science test that Friday. I didn\u2019t eat lunch that day, I just took it out of my bag and threw it away. Food disgusted me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you eating anything, Hannah?\u201d My friend Abbi asked me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cNot hungry.\u201d I said and just lied my head down. I was.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Abbi was one of my closest friends at the time. We could write a paragraph about what one of us were thinking about just by looking at each others faces. She was always there for me, but she also has self-confidence issues so I didn&amp;#39;t bring up mine with her. I knew better than to talk about my issues with her. She always found a way to make them about herself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fourth period rolled around and that\u2019s when I\u2019d almost always fall asleep. I can\u2019t help that no one talks so it\u2019s always quiet in my History class. My teacher, Mrs.John hated it, but it was nice to have a relaxing class. I like history, it\u2019s an easier subject to learn unlike science and math. I got called on twice to answer questions, I hate being called on. The spotlight is not for me. I luckily knew the answers to both questions. I usually do, I just don\u2019t want to answer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fifth period had my favorite teacher, Mr.Scall. He was my english teacher and always nagged me about not writing enough. He still does to this day. I can be walking down the hall to third period and he\u2019ll stop me and say,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cHannah! You don\u2019t write enough.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019d say something along the lines of \u201cYes, I know Mr.Scall.\u201d and walk to third.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That day we were presenting our monologues to the class. Me and my friend Natasha decided to to act out a skit about &lt;em&gt;Shark Tank&lt;/em&gt;. Our prop was a zombie toy and I was one of the sharks. Natasha was presenting her item (the toy) to me and in the end, after we made the deal she said it was a fake. The class loved our act, but I still hate presenting things to this day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sixth period came and I walked to math class with Ms.Po. Sixth period was the only class I absolutely hated. The people there were always so wound up and always gave Ms.Po a hard time. There were only six people  in the class out of 15 that she actually could rely on to complete the work. Me of course, being one of them. People always say I throw myself into my work, it\u2019s true. It keeps me from thinking bad about myself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, sixth period went by fast and the bell rang. I walked to my locker and looked at the ground for the most part. I didn\u2019t want to see anyone\u2019s pretty faces again. I unlock my locker and open the cubby at the top again to put my books in it. I then grab my backpack and check my phone. Five miss calls from mom.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cGreat.\u201d I say to myself as the people beside me open their lockers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I put my phone in my hoodie pocket and put on my backpack straps. I next shut my locker and walked down the hall to my friend Alanna\u2019s locker.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Alanna is my second best friend. I honestly like her more than Abbi for some pretty obvious reasons. She\u2019s more humble and Abbi always tried so hard to make everything about her. Alanna on the other hand, doesn\u2019t talk about herself enough. I worry about her. She always had her blonde hair up in a bun or a ponytail. She mostly wears hoodies, like me and sweatpants. We both prefer to be comfortable over stylish.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cHey.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cHey.\u201d She replies and shuts her locker. We walk down the hall and down the stairs to exit the school building.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cHow was your day?\u201d I asked as we walked over to the tree in the front of the building to wait for our rides to get there. The grounds in front of the building look so much bigger when there are people on almost every inch of it. Great, more pretty faces to look at.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cIt was good. Ms.Hob\u2019s class was fun.\u201d Alanna replies. She starts to talk about what they did but I wasn\u2019t paying attention. That\u2019s when I saw him. He was standing just a few feet in front of me talking to some of the people who ride my bus. I didn\u2019t recognize him until now but, he rides my bus too. For a second it seemed like time had frozen. Everything around me that was still, it\u2019s like the Earth shifted and everything that needed to be balanced, was.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cHannah?\u201d A distant voice calls and it snaps me back to reality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cHannah! Your bus is here! Hello?\u201d Alanna shouts and I blink at her blakely. I look at her and back at him getting on the bus and I swear I could see him smiling and shaking his head at me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWhat is this witchcraft?\u201d I laugh to myself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cUm, what?\u201d Alanna asks confused. \u201cNevermind, just get on the bus before it leaves you behind.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I turned and started walking to my bus, in what seemed like autopilot.  I couldn\u2019t think straight as I sat down next to Lea on the bus.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cDude, what happened? You look actually shooketh.\u201d  Lea asks, concerned.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cNothing.\u201d I assure all to quickly, even for me. \u201c I um\u2026 I\u2019ll text you later about it,\u201d I say trying to recover from my quick reply.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cOkay?\u201d Lea says and puts in her ear buds to listen to music.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I did the same and halfway through the bus ride home, I open my eyes that where apparently closed. A reaction to his voice I heard yelling out of one of the bus windows.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cYou\u2019re smoking cancer sticks!\u201d He calls out to people who are walking down the sidewalks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I smile and shake my head. \u201cWhat is his name?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cJacob!\u201d Mr.Jo calls, \u201cSit down and cut that out before you cause me to crash this bus.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cJacob.\u201d I think to myself, smiling as I shake my head.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cOh, you wouldn\u2019t do that Mr.Jo!\u201d Jacob replies smiling, as he shuts the window and heads back to his seat.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can\u2019t help but listen to the conversations on the bus the rest of the ride home. Almost everyone had gotten off the bus by the time I put my earbuds away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cBye Lea.\u201d I say as I move out of her way so she can get off of the bus.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cBye, my dude.\u201d She calls back and starts to walk home.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Everyone who sits in the back of the bus then moves up to the front for the last two stops. The bus driver turns the corner to mine and Desi\u2019s bus stop and we stand up to get off.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cBye Desi, bye Hannah.\u201d Jacob says as we walk off the bus.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cBye.\u201d Desi laughs and starts to walk home.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I couldn\u2019t say anything back. I was afraid I\u2019d choke if I tried.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cHow does he know my name?\u201d I  whisper to myself as I walk home on the sidewalk. I look up to see my dogs in the window wagging their tails. They start to bark as I open the mailbox to get the mail.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks aging for reading this. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
