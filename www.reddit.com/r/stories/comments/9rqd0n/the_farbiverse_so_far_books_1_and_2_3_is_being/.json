(Also it's just made as a stupid comedy series.)***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Book 1*\n\nThe Miracle of Memes\n\nThe year was -2000. Memes, non-existent. Nowhere to be found. Even if you pulled out your meme detector it couldn\u2019t sense anything. It was a void. A memeless void. \n\nWhen you conjure images of voids in your mind you think of darkness. Nothingness. This memeless void wasn\u2019t like that. There was light, gases, matter, all the basic stuff you find in simple dimensions. There were planets, grass, people. The void wasn\u2019t empty, just memeless. There were gods, cities, countries, and creatures. Almost everything that is in the known universe. Men fought. Wars waged. It only lacked memes.\n\nHermes, the god of mischief was pursuing his realm one fine day. He passed the Pillars of Creation, Neptune, and then came upon Earth. \u2018*Ah, home.\u2019* Hermes thought. He landed down on the rocky planet. He walked aimlessly taking in the earthy air. He let his fingers run through the tall grass, feeling every blade, every cell. \n\n\u201cWah!\u201d a nearby voice spoke.\n\nHermes was confused. He believed that he had heard every sound of every creature on Earth.\n\n\u201cHello?\u201d Hermes asked.\n\n\u201cWah.\u201d It spoke back.\n\nHermes parted some grass and his eyes fell upon a blob of living fat. It had eyes, a mouth, a nose. It had tiny hands and feet that were barely visible, tucked away by the fat. It looked around, seemingly confused, taking in its surroundings.\n\n\u201cWah?\u201d It said.\n\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d Hermes asked the living blob.\n\n\u201cGlarbo!\u201d It said.\n\n\u201cGlarbo? Who created you? Was Zeus drunk again?\u201d Hermes said. Glarbo twitched with excitement.\n\n\u201cBoy, I don\u2019t know.\u201d Glarbo said.\n\n\u201cAre you lost, Glarbo?\u201d Hermes asked the strange creature. Glarbo glanced around for whoever said his name.\n\n\u201cMaybe.\u201d Glarbo said, unsure.\n\nHermes picked up Glarbo and held him in his hands. Hermes started to run and came upon the closest village. Hermes made sure to disguise himself before he came into the village.\n\n\u201cHello, peasants! Have you seen this creature before?\u201d Hermes asked, disguised as a wizard.\n\n\u201cWhy, yes! That\u2019s Glarbo! Don\u2019t you know Glarbo? Who doesn\u2019t know Glarbo?\u201d The peasant said. \n\n\u201cWhy was he out in a field?\u201d Hermes asked.\n\n\u201cWe exiled him.\u201d A blacksmith chimed in.\n\n\u201cWhy would you exile this Glarbo? He seems harmless enough. Look at his tiny hands! He\u2019s physically incapable of hurting an insect with them! Just look at his hands!\u201d Hermes said.\n\n\u201cOh, really? He broke 7 of my pots in one day because he thought I said his name.\u201d The potter said.\n\n\u201cHe squished half my loaves of bread one day for the same reason.\u201d The baker said.\n\n\u201cThis tiny creature did all that?\u201d Hermes said.\n\n\u201cHe can do things some might say are impossible.\u201d A farmer said.\n\n\u201cEver seen a fly trying to get out of a house? He\u2019s like that but worse and breaks all your stuff.\u201d The peasant said.\n\nHermes put Glarbo down on the ground because he was getting a little fidgety.\n\n\u201cJust say something that remotely sounds like his name.\u201d The blacksmith said.\n\n\u201cHarbor.\u201d Hermes said.\n\n\u201cWah!\u201d Glarbo yelled. He sprung forward hitting a cow, tipping over a bottle of wine, hitting a merchant in the back of the head, bounced off and landed on top of Hermes head.\n\n\u201cSee?\u201d The blacksmith said.\n\n\u201cWell maybe you can make a deal with him.\u201d Hermes said,\n\n\u201cHa! A deal? With Glarbo? What a joke!\u201d The blacksmith laughed.\n\n\u201cCome, Glarbo.\u201d Hermes said. Glarbo jumped into Hermes\u2019 hands and they walked off. As Hermes and Glarbo walked throughout the streets of this village he noticed that not once did he see someone smiling. Not even a grin, nor a smirk! It was a humorless village.\n\n\u201cGlarbo, all these people are so boring. No one\u2019s laughing.\u201d Hermes whispered to Glarbo.\n\n\u201cI can make \u2018em laugh, just you see.\u201d Glarbo said. He bounced off of Hermes\u2019 hands and grabbed a piece of paper from a printing press and hopped towards an author and stole his pencil.\n\n\u201cGlarbo!\u201d Multiple voices yelled. Tomatoes were thrown. Apples chucked. Rocks pelted. Hermes had to shield Glarbo. Glarbo was drawing something. It was a crude drawing of a man. His hands were in the air and he said one word. \u201cFarbus.\u201d He showed it to a nearby potter and he laughed so hard he almost choked. \n\n\u201cWah! See?\u201d Glarbo gloated.\n\n\u201cAh, I see. Farbus\u201d Hermes said, dumbfounded.\n\nGlarbo made another copy of the Farbus drawing and drew 5 more, and 10 more and 20 more until he had a thick pile of Farbus drawings. Glarbo jumped around the village and stuck the drawings to walls and doors. He jumped around handing them to people he landed on. Within 5 seconds the whole village erupted in laughter. \n\n\u201cHa, Farbus! So original! Please make more of these!\u201d A peasant said.\n\n\u201cHmm, Glarbo, you\u2019re pretty good at this.\u201d Hermes said.\n\n\u201cYes, If I am going to make more I will have to name them something. How about, memes. Yes, memes, what a great name.\u201d\n\n***The end***. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Book 2*\n\n The Holy Glibble\n\nOn 10/29, 1029 BC Glarbo invented memes. Everybody seeked to create the same high quality memes as Glarbo. Pewdiepie tried. Scarce tried. Keemstar tried. None of them were capable of creating high quality memes like Glarbo. Glarbo was the only one. \n\nThe Pews under the guidance of Pewdiepie waged war against the Scarces and the Keems. This war started on the 100 year anniversary of the creation of memes.\n\nPeople attempted to rise to the same level as Glarbo through meme practices and religion. People worshipped Glarbo. Some hated him. Some wanted to be him. Thus began the Great Meme War.\n\nThe Keems stole the the Sacred Meme Texts out from under Glarbo's watchful eye. This angered Glarbo. \u201cWahhh!\u201d he screamed. He sent out on a journey for the Sacred Meme Texts.\n\nGlarbo disguised himself as a slightly more human version of himself. His new, human name was Glarbodysseus. He passed through human villages torn apart by the Great Meme War. He was disappointed. *Memes are supposed to bring people together, not tear them apart.* Glarbo was saddened. Memes brought people together for generations, for decades. Memes were a symbol of peace.\n\nGlarbo came upon a dark and dank forest. He walked through the forest and heard a great noise. \n\n\u201cBobo wants a corner! Bobo! Bobo wants a corner!\u201d \n\n*What is this beautiful singing?* Glarbo thought. \n\nHe felt himself being drawn toward the sound. He found the source. A herd of Bobos. Bobos are dangerous because once you get close enough they will eat you. Glarbo knew this and flew away.\n\nGlarbo used his powerful mind to erect a great boat in the Gringer Bay. He set off through the sunset. His eyes fell upon devastated cities, destroyed by man\u2019s greed. Glarbo could not understand. How could something so beautiful turn so ugly? How? He came upon an island. Sklunkus Island. \n\nHe witnessed men fighting. He saw Pews. He saw Scarces. He saw Keems.\n\n\u201cFellas, I gotta keep it real with you. I am disappointed. You turned a symbol of peace into a symbol of yearning. Memes are studied. Not acquired. Memes are learned. Not bought. Do you understand? Hand over the Sacred Meme Texts.\u201d Glarbo said.\n\nThe Pews handed over the Sacred Meme Texts. Glarbo took them and gave them all a stern look. They all broke down crying.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re sorry! We\u2019re sorry!\u201d the men yelled.\n\nGlarbo flew away to his abode.\n\n***The end.***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",
