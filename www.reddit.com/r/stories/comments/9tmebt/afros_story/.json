Welll, i first met this blonde chick when i was in freshman year during an open mic night. She was nice and all and she introduced me to her friend (the chick that was the \"nicegirl\"). The\u00a0 blonde chick and nice girl invite me and a friend of mine to go to the mall and we do. On the way there, i notice nicegirl staring at me intensely and whenever i wanted to talk to blonde chick, she would alway try to put herself between blondie and me and would interject herself into the conversation when it was only me and blonde chick talking. Fast foward to junior year and i meet this dude (I'll call him Afro). He's pretty chill and would always be smiling. One day, i ask if he wanted to go singing with me (we were both in choir) and i notice that his smile gets shaky and i ask him whats wrong. Turns out, a chick wouldn't leave him alone. I told him to just tell her to fuck off (ikr, I'm an asshole) but he says he felt bad for her. So we go singing and i shit you not, during our entire rehersal, his phone wouldn't stop vibrating. He gets angry and we end our singing session early and the chick in question pops up to see Afro. It was nicegirl. She still had that intense glare, but this time, it was directed toward Afro. Afro and i had many common friends and me -being the curious guy i am- ask people what's the deal. Turns out, many of our common friends have stopped hanging around Afro because of nicegirl and how obssesive she was and also told me that he didn't want to stop being friends with her because he felt pity for her because everyone treated her badly. I confronted him about it and he told me the story: she liked him, but he only saw her as a friend and that angered her, so to change his mind, she slowly drove all his friends away from him. Not only that, but this had been happening since FRESHMAN YEAR! He still wouldn't leave her alone because he said that she saw him as the one good person in his life and he didn't want to ruin that for her. Me, again being the asshole i am,\u00a0 told him that she was a toxic bitch and should consider who he calls friends more carefully. He agrees but doesn't do anything about the situation. Senior year rolls around and he tells me that he finally got rid of nicegirl. He told me it was \"the worst 3 years of my life\" and that if he knew that she would make his life a living hell, he would've never been friends with her.",
