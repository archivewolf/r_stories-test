It would rain in the morning, he'd  grab (or buy) an umbrella and take it to work. In the afternoon it would  be nice and he'd just not think about the umbrellas and head home.  \n \n\nOne day, when he realized that all FIVE of his umbrellas were downtown,  he decided to tough it out and go to work without an umbrella.  \n \n\nHe was sitting next to a train next to a woman, and when they reached  his stop, he absent mindedly picked up HER umbrella and started to  leave. She said, loudly, \"HEY THAT'S \\*MY\\* UMBRELLA\". He apologized to  her, said it was an accident, and gave it back.  \n \n\nThis stuck in his mind all day, so when it was time to leave, he grabbed the umbrellas.  \n \n\nWho does he run into on the way home? It's the same woman who sees him  get on the train now carrying five umbrellas. She's giving him the stink  eye and he decides that nothing is going to change what she's thinking,  so, as he walks by her, he smiles and says, \"It was a good day!\"",
