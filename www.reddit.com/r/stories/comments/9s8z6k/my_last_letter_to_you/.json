But I don\u2019t believe you have to be old to feel strongly about someone...Sure people make mistakes. but somehow, you always have the craziest and strangest feeling when you know. You feel some type of way. You do things you\u2019ve never done before. And everything you do with them, no matter how boring it may seem, whether it\u2019d be looking at books at a library, whether itd be hanging out at a train station for what seems to be like hours, or whether you guys are laying down looking at clouds. both of you are having the time of your lives..It almost seems like Time flies at the speed of light when you\u2019re with them. And no matter the consequences, you\u2019re always willing to make a sacrifice for them. When you\u2019re with them it almost seems as if all your problems are gone. You forget about everything, and everyone. And although we argue and tend to bump heads at times, we never lose focus of the fact that we love each other, and at the end of the day we remind each other that we still love one another, so neither of us are there worrying. You may not know everything you\u2019ve done for me. You may not know the help you\u2019ve been. You\u2019ve been there at my lowest and somehow you helped during those times I felt down but didn\u2019t tell you. i truly feel you were created for me however I don\u2019t know why..I don\u2019t deserve the world?. Last thing I wanted to say is thank you, thank you for being you. You is what was best for me. you kept me strong, Thank you for sticking by my side through everything, thank you for the last bit of memories you have created for me. I will never forget them. although my time is up, Our time will continue to live on. You were an angel sent to take care of me..It\u2019s my turn to be yours now. \n\n\nSincerely. a kid in love.\n",
