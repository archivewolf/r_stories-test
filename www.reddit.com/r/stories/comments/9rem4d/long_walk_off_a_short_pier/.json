Enjoy, or don't.\n\nThe Child waited anxiously by the door, like a dog \nawaiting it\u2019s owners return. He sat there, fidgeting, waiting. As the door opened, he bolted toward it, and jumped at the Man when he walked into view. \u201cDad!\u201d the Child yelled as the Man caught him in his arms; then it all went black.\n\n\nThe Man jerked awake, and his eyes darted around the room, searching for the family that wasn\u2019t there. His expression sullied as he remembered they were gone. The Man walked down the long road east; cars littered it like leaves on a lawn in autumn, some blackened from fire. The silence, while calming to most, was unsettling to the Man. Silence only meant the man was alone to his thoughts, and in his state, none of them were good. The Man continued down the road.\n\n\nThe Child told the Man of the things he did when the Man was away; stories of new friends, things learned at his first year at school, and the time the Man missed. The Mother congratulated the Child on his achievements. The Child noticed the Man staring off into the distance. The Child tried to get his attention, first saying his name, then shaking him. The Man snapped back into reality with a scream louder than the Child had ever heard, then it all went black.\n\n\nThe Man bolted upright, screaming,with eyes zipping around like a fly trapped inside a room. He calmed down and noticed his fire dwindling. He got up and walked into the dark of night, in search of the fuel he needed. The Man, busy gathering the fuel, heard a crack in the bushes nearby. Before he had the chance to react, he felt cold steel against the nape of his neck, and heard the familiar click he knew all too well.\n\n\nThe Man was laid in bed with his wife, discussing the crisis forming around the world. The Mother then changed the subject to the events that occured at dinner. All the Man could think in that moment was how his mattress felt like a marshmallow in comparison to what he was used to. The Man\u2019s attention returned back to the conversation when the Mother waved her hand in front of his face; he looked shocked for a second, and then resumed with the conversation. It quickly turned into an argument over what had happened over dinner. \u201cWhat if I do something worse?\u201d the Man asks his wife. \u201cYou just need to readjust to life here,\u201d she said in attempt to calm him down. \u201cWhat will I do in the meantime while I\u2019m \u2018readjusting?\u201d he continued. \u201cWhy can\u2019t you just take him to the park? I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be fine,\u201d she replied, in an attempt to reaffirm him by rubbing his shoulder. \u201cBut he was terrified of me from what happened at dinner.\u201d. The Man\u2019s face saddened as the words left his lips. \u201cHe is your son, he will never be terrified of you.\u201d. \u201cAlright, I\u2019ll give it a shot.\u201d. A faint smile finally appeared across his stressed face as he begrudgingly agreed. It all went black.\n\n\n\u201cHands behind your head!\u201d the Gunman ordered, pressing the barrel of the gun harder against the Man\u2019s head. \u201cSteady now, be calm,\u201d The Man said, raising his hands. \u201c I\u2019m the one with the gun, I make the orders,\u201d the Gunman said as he walked around to face the Man. \u201cWhat\u2019s in the bag?\u201d the Gunman demanded. \u201cNothing you need,\u201d the Man answered. \u201cI didn\u2019t ask if I needed it, give it to me\u201d the Gunman ordered. \u201cI can\u2019t do that,\u201d the Man said, his hands balling into fists. \u201cDo I look like I care about what you can\u2019t do? Give me the bag, now!\u201d. The Gunman\u2019s hands shook as he yelled. As the Gunman pressed the gun barrel against the Man\u2019s head, a large crack echoes in the distance. As the Gunman\u2019s attention left the situation at hand for the briefest of moments, the Man took the chance he had been waiting for. He grabbed the barrel of the gun, and ripped it from the Gunman\u2019s grasp.\n\n\nThe Man stood over the Gunman. He almost didn\u2019t recall doing it; muscle memory, as grim as it may be, was true. He was used to it. The Man looked into the Gunman\u2019s eyes, glossy now, but still terrified. The Man checked the Gunman\u2019s pockets, and to his surprise, found the Gunman\u2019s wallet. Opening it, he found something that only pushed him further back into the dark.\n\n\nThe Man sat at a bench, and watched his son play with other children. The manic running reminded him of his past, although this was less violent. He pushed the thought out of his mind. The Man joined his son in play; he chased him, carried him on his shoulders, and pushed him on the swings. Every time the Man went away, he lost months of watching his son grow up. This last time, he lost a year. The Man then saw something in the distance that finally pushed him past his limit. The Man watched closely as a new group of children joined them in play. As they ran towards his son, they pulled something out of their pockets: cap guns. In the Man\u2019s head, they were no toys. He jumped up and ran to his shield his son from the impending threat. The last thing he remembered was the black returning to consume him.\n\nAs the Man finished digging the Gunman\u2019s grave, he hoped they weren\u2019t around to miss him. He caught his thoughts before they left his head. He found them disgusting, and wondered what had brought him to this place inside his head. The Man wedged the photo of the Gunman\u2019s family into the makeshift cross, right before walking off into the dark of the night.\n\n\nThe Man reluctantly said goodbye to his family. They didn\u2019t know if they would ever see him again. Tears streamed from the Child\u2019s eyes like a river as he begged and pleaded for the Man not to leave. But the Man had his duty; he had to serve. The Man kissed the Mother, opened the door, and walked into the black.\n\n\nThe Man started approaching his house. As he neared it, he saw that half of it had been \u00a0scorched as black as coal. He stepped toward the house with caution. He didn\u2019t want the question that had lingered in his head for so long to be answered, even though he knew what it would be. The Man opened the door, and walked into the black.\n\n\nThe Man argued over the crisis with the Mother. She said the riots there were too much, and that she needed him home. The Man could hear it in her voice; the fear, as well as the noise outside, the yelling, the glass breaking. The Child told his father he was scared to come home, and he begged and pleaded to the Man to protect them. He knew he had to help them, but he also thought about how long it would take to get there. Across the country felt like across the world at this point, but it was his only option. Suddenly, he heard the door break. The Mother told the child to hide. The last thing the Man said to his family is that he promised he would find them, and that he would make their family whole again. The last thing he heard was his family\u2019s screams, right before seeing a blinding flash of light. The screen went black.\n\n\nHe found his answer in their bedroom. He couldn\u2019t even recognize them, burnt and mutilated, but he saw the wedding band on her finger. He had failed them. He wished he\u2019d never left, \u00a0and he felt something he hadn\u2019t felt in a long time. Tears flowed down his face. He buried his family in the three holes he dug. He thought constantly of the time he spent with his family; the fighting, the leaving, the happy times. His last thought was of when he brought his son to the park to play. With their picture held against his forehead, he placed the barrel of the gun in his mouth, the cold steel scraping against his teeth . His last tear rolled down his face as he pulled the trigger. It all went black...\n\n\nThe Child looked back into the distance. The sound, while not unfamiliar to him, sounded lonesome and distant, yet still, he found it hold his attention. The sudden noise felt like it meant something to him. The Child saw smoke rising from his old town, his home, like steam rising from his plate at dinner. The Child\u2019s attention snapped forward again as The Mother took his arm, pulling him away. \u201cWe have to leave, home isn\u2019t safe anymore. We have to go find your Father.\u201d She said. They started walking their long walk, into the black.\n\n\n",
