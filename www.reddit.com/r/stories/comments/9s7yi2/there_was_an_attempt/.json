A large rift opened up and aliens were spuing out. He immediately looked around his house for weapons. All his neighbors were in panic grabbing what they could, getting in their cars,  driving off. His family was nowhere to be found cell service was out, landlines were down. He finds a crowbar and a handheld radio in his garage and starts walking down the street. Speeding cars pass him by none stop for him. He feels an overwhelming feeling of courage and heads toward the rift. \"I am going to figure out what is going on\" he thinks to himself. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNot too far down the street he hears a scream and sees a woman under attack by an alien. With his trusty crowbar, he beats that alien down. He beats it dead. Saves the woman. She thanks him and runs away. He continues to head toward the rift in a somewhat stealthy way. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlong the way, he has to beat down and kill a few more aliens. Police and Swat are trying to kill the invaders. They are holding them back well enough for now. Over the radio, he can hear them call in the Military. Soon the military will be deployed to the location to help with the invasion. His courage is bold as before and he continues forward. Hiding from both the Police and the aliens. He comes across a Police officer that has lost his life in the fight. His service weapon and ammo are on the body and he takes both. Now armed with a pistol he sneaks on toward the rift. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe sneaks through an old-timey diner and out the back and he comes very close to the rift. The Military has arrived on the scene and is inspecting the rift via helicopter. the rift opened up on the south wall of a research facility. He sneaks in the facility and snoops around for clues. Any computers that are logged in he searches for text and reads up on the situation. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe finds out some scientist have discovered an alternate dimension and have been running experiments on the other side. They found the alien civilization and decided to nuke them. Their technology was more advanced and they neutralized the nuke and began the attack on our world. In the research facility he finds a special tool. ",
