The woman, slowly getting up, looks around, not aware of her whereabouts, the time, not even the year. As she looks around she notices a pool of blood in the middle of the brown carpet. She gets up disoriented, to go look in the bathroom mirror. She notices a faint scar on her forehead, she touches it, and sees a flash of light then collapses to the floor of the bathroom and is made unconscious, and a vision is seen. In this vision the woman sees a pentagram, drawn with blood on a marble floor, with candles on the corners and an unusual symbol in the middle of it. As unusual as it is, it seems familiar, looks like an upside down 7 next to another 7. The woman opens her eyes, regaining consciousness, and stands up, using the sink to support herself. She then looks at herself in the mirror again, her dark scarlet red hair all messy, and she appears to be light skinned, standing at around 5\u20195\u201d with a thin physique. she looks down from her face and notices she is nude and her hands covered in blood. She turns on the sink, running a slight stream of water and cleans the blood off her hands. To the right of her in the background of the mirror, she sees a door slightly cracked open, with a bed and a foot on the mattress. She turns around and walks towards the room, opening the door slowly, hearing the door creak open. When she enters the room she sees a woman, tied to the bed, wearing black lingerie and laying in a pool of blood, seemingly being her own, with her throat slit. The woman appears to be white with long brown hair, brown eyes and an average physique. The mysterious woman looks at the body and takes notice of the lingerie and feeling envious she says, \u201cDeath looks good on you, but your corpse won't be needing this anymore.\u201d The mysterious woman undresses the dead girl and heads to the bathroom to soak out the blood in the lingerie, then puts it on herself. Admiring herself in the mirror she notices a clock on the nightstand in the bedroom, she looks toward the clock which reads 3:00 A.M. in a neon green. The woman then again sees a flash of light and collapses to the floor. Another vision is seen, this time of a grandfather clock striking 3:00 am while seen in the reflection of the clock, slightly blurry, is a man tied up in the middle of a pentagram. The woman opens her eyes and picks herself up off the floor with a slight groan. She then heads to the front door of the apartment and leaves. Next to the front door was a calendar, the calendar being pinned on the month of July, and the year being 1999. The woman leaves the apartments and starts walking down an empty street like a stray dog, the surrounding buildings looking old, worn down or abandoned. As the woman is walking aimlessly she then again collapses to a flash of light and sees another vision. The woman sees only a dagger with the same strange symbol that was in the pentagram, engraved in the hilt. The symbol looking like an \u201cL7\u201d. \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The woman wakes up frantically, and notices she is no longer on the street, but in a bed. She looks to her right and sees a clock that reads 7:29 P.M. in red. A man dressed in an officers uniform is standing in the room and sets a chair up next to the bed sits down and says, \u201cGood you're awake.\u201d The woman sits up, looks at the man and asks, \u201cWhere am I?\u201d \u201cThe Man of Hope Hospital\u201d the officer says. The officer is an African American that is bald and has a goatee, brown eyes, and a fit physique. He then begins to speak again saying, \u201cNow that you're awake, I'd like to ask some questions. Starting with your name.\u201d \u201cMy name?\u201d the woman replies. \u201cYes, your name, what is it?\u201d says the officer sternly. The woman sits in silence, thinking for an answer to give the officer. Then she finally speaks up and says, \u201cAriel.\u201d \u201cOkay, and tell me Ariel, why were you wondering the streets at 4:00 a.m. in only your lingerie not even a block away from a crime scene, we have some of the clothing items you left at the scene in the storage room here so we know you were there. Are you an escort?\u201d The officer asks. \u201cNo.\u201d replies Ariel. \u201cNo, of course not.\u201d says the officer, staring at Ariel with suspicion. The officer looking at Ariel, scanning her from head to toe with his eyes then says, \u201cListen, you look like a nice girl, and I'd hate to turn a nice girl like you in... so lets make a deal.\u201d \u201cA deal?\u201d Ariel asks, \u201cWhat kind of deal?\u201d \u201cThe best kind.\u201d replies the officer with a smirk on his face. The officer leans in closer to Ariel, then kisses her neck. Ariel shocked by this action begins to feel a sense of arousal. The officer then hoists himself on top of Ariel and they begin to kiss vigorously. Ariel then swaps position with the officer, hoisting herself on top of him taking his handcuffs and cuffing him to the bed frame. Exposing herself from her guise, Ariel then takes the tip of a nearby IV bag and sticks it in the neck of the officer, piercing perfectly through the man's jugular vein. The man under shock, pulls out the tip and begins to spue blood all over the bed, himself, Ariel and the hospital floor. Ariel smiles, pleased with her sinful actions and watches as the officer gasps his last breath. She then gets out of the bed, exits the room and begins to run down the hallway. As she's running she sees another vision, this is of a white \u201cL\u201d like symbol, and she falls to the floor. Barely catching herself with her hands, she stands up and notices a room next to her labeled as, \u201cStorage\u201d. She opens the door and sees a box of clothes. In the box were a black bra and panties, black combat boots, black long socks, ripped black jeans, a black leather belt with white studs, a black crop top, black fingerless biker gloves and a black leather jacket with the white \u201cL\u201d symbol she just saw on the back of it. She feels a burning sensation on her left hand, she looks at her hand and burning through her hand was a strange rune that began to give off a dark purple hue. Ariel opened the palm of her hand and her hand began to give of the same purple hue. After a few seconds a black dagger with a purple aura was conjured into her hand. Ariel jumps back in shock dropping the dagger, and just before the dagger hits the ground it disappears. She opens her palm again, imagining the same dagger she just saw, and it reconjured into Ariel's hand. She drops the dagger again and this time tries to imagine something different, she tries to imagine a flame like what she saw on the candles in her vision, and in the middle of her hand was a purple ball of flame. Ariel closes her hand, amazed with her newfound abilities, and feeling a sense of augmentation. Just as Ariel begins to leave she sees a box of surgical masks and puts one on, knowing there are cameras throughout the Hospital. Ariel makes her way out the front of the Hospital, the Hospital being strangely empty with nobody even behind the front desk, and into a rather empty parking lot. One of the closest cars being a midnight blue 1994 mustang. She walks up and tries to open the door, but its locked. She looks at the lock on the door and opens her hand, imagining the key that is needed. The key is then conjured and Ariel successfully opens the door. Ariel sits in the driver's seat, closes the door and looks in the glove box. She discovers a Black Hawk 9mm handgun, a spare key, and a stack of legal papers. Ariel takes the gun and puts it in the passenger seat, and uses the spare key for the ignition. She then drives the car out of the Hospital parking lot and makes her way towards the nearby city.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Ariel drives through a brightly lit city with neon signs everywhere, the city, filled of sin and vice, reeked of Greed and Gluttony. One of the many stores Ariel drives by sells TV's and many other home appliances, on the TV's in the window it shows the apartment Ariel woke up in, with a news caption saying \u201cBreaking news: Murderer on the Loose, Search in Progress.\" Ariel hears a cops siren just a few car links behind her, and she pulls over into a nearby alley, turning off her car and laying her seat down. She eagerly watches as the cop rushes passed the alley entrance. Ariel laughs then notices her car is surrounded by three dark figures. Ariel reaches for the gun in the passenger seat but is pulled out of the car from the driver side, one of the figures opens the passenger door and grabs the gun. Ariel is thrown onto the floor and picks herself up to see three unknown men in front of her. As the men walk closer to her she tries backing away, but is grabbed from behind by another man who sticks a knife up to Ariels throat. The man laughs and says, \u201cGotcha! You ain't goin anywhere you pretty little thing!\u201d Ariel smirks and opens her hand on the man's thigh, engulfing him in black and purple flame. The man screams then shortly becomes a mere pile of ash and ember. The three men petrified are paralyzed from fear at the site of the man disintegrating in front of them. Ariel laughs, picks up the knife and smiles at the men, two of the men take a fearful step back while the one with the gun pulls up the gun to point at Ariel, but before he can fully extend Ariel slits the man's throat and takes the gun. The other two frantically turn and run, Ariel then throws the knife at one's back, knocking him to the floor, and the other trips on a trash can and tries to get back up. Ariel then conjures a hook and throws it at him, catching him by the shoulder she reels him quickly toward her. The man screams as Ariel catches him by the neck. Ariel pulls the gun up to the side of his head and pulls the trigger, flinging brain matter all over the alley wall and spurting blood onto Ariel's face. \u201cOh God, oh God, oh fucking shit!\u201d the man on the floor yells, trying to crawl away. Ariel slowly walks towards the man dropping the gun as she walks. \u201cOh my God, I'm so fucking sorry, please, please don't kill me I'm begging you!!!\u201d \u201cThere is no God here.\u201d replies Ariel opening her hand to conjure. But this time instead of conjuring pure energy, a chain with a hook flies from the left side of the alley, she opens her other hand and a chains flies from the right side of the alley. Ariel then digs both hooks under the man's shoulder blades. The chains pull back, lifting the man off the ground, \u201cAHHHHH!!! OHHH MY GODDD!!!\u201d The man shrieks for his life, as he slowly gets pulled apart by the chains. \u201cAHHHHHHH!!!\u201d The man lets out one final yell as you hear the fleshy tear of skin, muscle and veins, and the snap-cracking of bone as he gets pulled in half, his lifeless corpse hanging in the alley. \u201cF-freeze!!!\u201d Yell two cops from the entrance of the alley, Ariel grinning, opens her hand and the handgun flies towards her open hand. Ariel with extraordinary agility turns around firing two rounds towards the cops. Just as the bullets are about to connect to the authorities arteries, a wall of blinding light, outlined with a golden aura appears in front of them, making contact with the bullets. A golden lightning bolt strikes in front of the wall and a man, wearing white ripped jeans, white shoes, a black leather belt, and a white T-shirt with a black \u201c7\u201d on the back, appears out of the bolt. He has blonde hair, brown eyes, white skin, is around 5\u201910\u201d and has a athletic physique. The man turns and looks at Ariel. Ariel fires two rounds at the man and he lifts his hand, conjuring a gold plate of energy, and deflects both rounds. \u201cWho are you?\u201d Ariel asks. \u201cJohn, the representation of absolute virtue, and you are?\u201d says the man. \u201cWhy does it matter?\u201d replies Ariel. \u201cYou have too much pride Ariel, just thought I'd ask, I've been keeping track of a lot of your sins.\u201d says John. \u201cIf you already knew my name, then why\u2019d you ask?\u201d snaps Ariel. \u201cThought I'd be polite.\u201d John snaps back. \u201cAfter all, you and I are the same person.\u201d \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d replies Ariel, dumbfounded by what John had said. \u201cThe visions, you get them too do you not? How do you think I found you? It wasn't coincidence, you and I are connected. The pentagram, the dagger, the symbol. The man...do you not remember who that man was?\u201d Ariel gets a sharp pain in her temples and groans. She gets a vision of the man, a close up of him. He has short brown hair, white skin, and an average physique. He's blindfolded, ball gagged and shackled in the middle of a pentagram. The symbol \u201cL7\u201d written in blood on his torso. A man, wearing all black hooded robes and a plague doctor's mask takes the dagger Ariel saw in earlier visions. The grandfather clock strikes 3:00 am and the mysterious man takes the dagger and cuts the man in bondage down the middle of his torso, spilling everything he had inside. The mysterious man takes a bowl of the man's blood and puts it on a nearby altar made of granite. The man then begins to speak in something of another language, something of a hymn. Then a ring of fire appears around the pentagram and two bloody bodies are conjured, one male, one female. The vision stops but the pain still lingers in Ariel's temples. \u201cYou see, we are artificial, made of the same person, split by sin and virtue, you being pure sin, me being absolute virtue, and I'm here to reverse the effect. To become one again, and eliminate not only myself, but you as well, as abominations.\u201d says John. \u201cNo!\u201d Ariel replies \u201cI will never go back, never! I'm blood thirsty!\u201d Ariel's hands engulf in flame and she throws black fire at John. John dodges both blasts of fire with ease and runs at Ariel. Ariel goes to conjure a blade but as she does John tackles her, forcing her to drop the blade and unconjure it. Ariel kicks John off of her and swings at him hitting him in the chest. John staggers back and lets out a blast of white energy, knocking back Ariel. Ariel gets up and conjures two daggers, John takes action and conjures a white sword outlined with a golden aura. Ariel goes to attack John and John deflects several of Ariel's attacks. Ariel then is successful and strikes one of John's ribs, forcing John to yell. Ariel, seeing blood surface from John, smiles with bloodlust, and goes for the kill, aiming for his kidney. John catches the blade with his hand and breaks Ariel's arm. \u201cGAHHH!!!\u201d yells Ariel, staggering backward. Ariel grabs her arm and twists it, fixing the fracture John had caused. Filled with wrath, Ariel throws her dagger at John. John dodges, runs up to Ariel and kicks her in the gut, throwing her back about 25 feet. John then conjures his own dagger and throws it at Ariel as she's getting up, the hilt hits her and cuts her forehead. This has been the first time Ariel witnessed her own blood being presented. Ariel screams, covering her wound and looking up at John. John stands there patiently for Ariel's next move. Ariel looks at the hand she covered her wound with and it's covered in blood...her blood. Her hand begins to become luminescent with a crimson red. \u201cWhat the-? Oh no!\u201d John looks in shock and realizes the threat level of the situation, so he rushes towards Ariel. Ariel, not focusing on John puts her clean hand on the pavement, a ring of black fire engulfs around Ariel, stopping John from advancing. \u201cNO!\u201d John yells. Ariel then puts her bloody hand on the asphalt as well, conjuring a pentagram made of blood around Ariel. \u201cHmm...let's try this.\u201d says Ariel, uncertain but unreluctant. The space within the ring of fire emplodes, blasting everything within a block from the alley into ash, ember and flame and causing a blinding flash of light...\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...The year is 1999, and the mysterious woman wakes up. The woman, slowly getting up, looks around, not aware of her whereabouts, the time, not even the year. As she looks around she notices a pool of blood in the middle of the brown carpet. She gets up disoriented, to go look in the bathroom mirror. She notices a faint scar on her forehead. She sees behind her a clock on the bedroom nightstand, saying 3:00 A.M. She looks back at herself, and smiles...",

A man dressed in an officers uniform is standing in the room and sets a chair up next to the bed sits down and says, \u201cGood you&amp;#39;re awake.\u201d The woman sits up, looks at the man and asks, \u201cWhere am I?\u201d \u201cThe Man of Hope Hospital\u201d the officer says.

Exposing herself from her guise, Ariel then takes the tip of a nearby IV bag and sticks it in the neck of the officer, piercing perfectly through the man&amp;#39;s jugular vein. The man under shock, pulls out the tip and begins to spue blood all over the bed, himself, Ariel and the hospital floor. Ariel smiles, pleased with her sinful actions and watches as the officer gasps his last breath. She then gets out of the bed, exits the room and begins to run down the hallway. As she&amp;#39;s running she sees another vision, this is of a white \u201cL\u201d like symbol, and she falls to the floor. Barely catching herself with her hands, she stands up and notices a room next to her labeled as, \u201cStorage\u201d. She opens the door and sees a box of clothes. In the box were a black bra and panties, black combat boots, black long socks, ripped black jeans, a black leather belt with white studs, a black crop top, black fingerless biker gloves and a black leather jacket with the white \u201cL\u201d symbol she just saw on the back of it. She feels a burning sensation on her left hand, she looks at her hand and burning through her hand was a strange rune that began to give off a dark purple hue. Ariel opened the palm of her hand and her hand began to give of the same purple hue. After a few seconds a black dagger with a purple aura was conjured into her hand. Ariel jumps back in shock dropping the dagger, and just before the dagger hits the ground it disappears. She opens her palm again, imagining the same dagger she just saw, and it reconjured into Ariel&amp;#39;s hand. She drops the dagger again and this time tries to imagine something different, she tries to imagine a flame like what she saw on the candles in her vision, and in the middle of her hand was a purple ball of flame. Ariel closes her hand, amazed with her newfound abilities, and feeling a sense of augmentation. Just as Ariel begins to leave she sees a box of surgical masks and puts one on, knowing there are cameras throughout the Hospital. Ariel makes her way out the front of the Hospital, the Hospital being strangely empty with nobody even behind the front desk, and into a rather empty parking lot. One of the closest cars being a midnight blue 1994 mustang. She walks up and tries to open the door, but its locked. She looks at the lock on the door and opens her hand, imagining the key that is needed. The key is then conjured and Ariel successfully opens the door. Ariel sits in the driver&amp;#39;s seat, closes the door and looks in the glove box. She discovers a Black Hawk 9mm handgun, a spare key, and a stack of legal papers. Ariel takes the gun and puts it in the passenger seat, and uses the spare key for the ignition. She then drives the car out of the Hospital parking lot and makes her way towards the nearby city.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Ariel drives through a brightly lit city with neon signs everywhere, the city, filled of sin and vice, reeked of Greed and Gluttony. One of the many stores Ariel drives by sells TV&amp;#39;s and many other home appliances, on the TV&amp;#39;s in the window it shows the apartment Ariel woke up in, with a news caption saying \u201cBreaking news: Murderer on the Loose, Search in Progress.&amp;quot; Ariel hears a cops siren just a few car links behind her, and she pulls over into a nearby alley, turning off her car and laying her seat down. She eagerly watches as the cop rushes passed the alley entrance. Ariel laughs then notices her car is surrounded by three dark figures. Ariel reaches for the gun in the passenger seat but is pulled out of the car from the driver side, one of the figures opens the passenger door and grabs the gun. Ariel is thrown onto the floor and picks herself up to see three unknown men in front of her. As the men walk closer to her she tries backing away, but is grabbed from behind by another man who sticks a knife up to Ariels throat. The man laughs and says, \u201cGotcha! You ain&amp;#39;t goin anywhere you pretty little thing!\u201d Ariel smirks and opens her hand on the man&amp;#39;s thigh, engulfing him in black and purple flame. The man screams then shortly becomes a mere pile of ash and ember. The three men petrified are paralyzed from fear at the site of the man disintegrating in front of them. Ariel laughs, picks up the knife and smiles at the men, two of the men take a fearful step back while the one with the gun pulls up the gun to point at Ariel, but before he can fully extend Ariel slits the man&amp;#39;s throat and takes the gun. The other two frantically turn and run, Ariel then throws the knife at one&amp;#39;s back, knocking him to the floor, and the other trips on a trash can and tries to get back up. Ariel then conjures a hook and throws it at him, catching him by the shoulder she reels him quickly toward her. The man screams as Ariel catches him by the neck. Ariel pulls the gun up to the side of his head and pulls the trigger, flinging brain matter all over the alley wall and spurting blood onto Ariel&amp;#39;s face. \u201cOh God, oh God, oh fucking shit!\u201d the man on the floor yells, trying to crawl away. Ariel slowly walks towards the man dropping the gun as she walks. \u201cOh my God, I&amp;#39;m so fucking sorry, please, please don&amp;#39;t kill me I&amp;#39;m begging you!!!\u201d \u201cThere is no God here.\u201d replies Ariel opening her hand to conjure. But this time instead of conjuring pure energy, a chain with a hook flies from the left side of the alley, she opens her other hand and a chains flies from the right side of the alley. Ariel then digs both hooks under the man&amp;#39;s shoulder blades. The chains pull back, lifting the man off the ground, \u201cAHHHHH!!! OHHH MY GODDD!!!\u201d The man shrieks for his life, as he slowly gets pulled apart by the chains. \u201cAHHHHHHH!!!\u201d The man lets out one final yell as you hear the fleshy tear of skin, muscle and veins, and the snap-cracking of bone as he gets pulled in half, his lifeless corpse hanging in the alley. \u201cF-freeze!!!\u201d Yell two cops from the entrance of the alley, Ariel grinning, opens her hand and the handgun flies towards her open hand. Ariel with extraordinary agility turns around firing two rounds towards the cops. Just as the bullets are about to connect to the authorities arteries, a wall of blinding light, outlined with a golden aura appears in front of them, making contact with the bullets. A golden lightning bolt strikes in front of the wall and a man, wearing white ripped jeans, white shoes, a black leather belt, and a white T-shirt with a black \u201c7\u201d on the back, appears out of the bolt. He has blonde hair, brown eyes, white skin, is around 5\u201910\u201d and has a athletic physique. The man turns and looks at Ariel. Ariel fires two rounds at the man and he lifts his hand, conjuring a gold plate of energy, and deflects both rounds. \u201cWho are you?\u201d Ariel asks. \u201cJohn, the representation of absolute virtue, and you are?\u201d says the man. \u201cWhy does it matter?\u201d replies Ariel. \u201cYou have too much pride Ariel, just thought I&amp;#39;d ask, I&amp;#39;ve been keeping track of a lot of your sins.\u201d says John. \u201cIf you already knew my name, then why\u2019d you ask?\u201d snaps Ariel. \u201cThought I&amp;#39;d be polite.\u201d John snaps back. \u201cAfter all, you and I are the same person.\u201d \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d replies Ariel, dumbfounded by what John had said. \u201cThe visions, you get them too do you not? How do you think I found you? It wasn&amp;#39;t coincidence, you and I are connected. The pentagram, the dagger, the symbol. The man...do you not remember who that man was?\u201d Ariel gets a sharp pain in her temples and groans. She gets a vision of the man, a close up of him. He has short brown hair, white skin, and an average physique. He&amp;#39;s blindfolded, ball gagged and shackled in the middle of a pentagram. The symbol \u201cL7\u201d written in blood on his torso. A man, wearing all black hooded robes and a plague doctor&amp;#39;s mask takes the dagger Ariel saw in earlier visions. The grandfather clock strikes 3:00 am and the mysterious man takes the dagger and cuts the man in bondage down the middle of his torso, spilling everything he had inside. The mysterious man takes a bowl of the man&amp;#39;s blood and puts it on a nearby altar made of granite. The man then begins to speak in something of another language, something of a hymn. Then a ring of fire appears around the pentagram and two bloody bodies are conjured, one male, one female. The vision stops but the pain still lingers in Ariel&amp;#39;s temples. \u201cYou see, we are artificial, made of the same person, split by sin and virtue, you being pure sin, me being absolute virtue, and I&amp;#39;m here to reverse the effect. To become one again, and eliminate not only myself, but you as well, as abominations.\u201d says John. \u201cNo!\u201d Ariel replies \u201cI will never go back, never! I&amp;#39;m blood thirsty!\u201d Ariel&amp;#39;s hands engulf in flame and she throws black fire at John. John dodges both blasts of fire with ease and runs at Ariel. Ariel goes to conjure a blade but as she does John tackles her, forcing her to drop the blade and unconjure it. Ariel kicks John off of her and swings at him hitting him in the chest. John staggers back and lets out a blast of white energy, knocking back Ariel. Ariel gets up and conjures two daggers, John takes action and conjures a white sword outlined with a golden aura. Ariel goes to attack John and John deflects several of Ariel&amp;#39;s attacks. Ariel then is successful and strikes one of John&amp;#39;s ribs, forcing John to yell. Ariel, seeing blood surface from John, smiles with bloodlust, and goes for the kill, aiming for his kidney. John catches the blade with his hand and breaks Ariel&amp;#39;s arm. \u201cGAHHH!!!\u201d yells Ariel, staggering backward. Ariel grabs her arm and twists it, fixing the fracture John had caused. Filled with wrath, Ariel throws her dagger at John. John dodges, runs up to Ariel and kicks her in the gut, throwing her back about 25 feet. John then conjures his own dagger and throws it at Ariel as she&amp;#39;s getting up, the hilt hits her and cuts her forehead. This has been the first time Ariel witnessed her own blood being presented. Ariel screams, covering her wound and looking up at John. John stands there patiently for Ariel&amp;#39;s next move. Ariel looks at the hand she covered her wound with and it&amp;#39;s covered in blood...her blood. Her hand begins to become luminescent with a crimson red. \u201cWhat the-? Oh no!\u201d John looks in shock and realizes the threat level of the situation, so he rushes towards Ariel. Ariel, not focusing on John puts her clean hand on the pavement, a ring of black fire engulfs around Ariel, stopping John from advancing. \u201cNO!\u201d John yells. Ariel then puts her bloody hand on the asphalt as well, conjuring a pentagram made of blood around Ariel. \u201cHmm...let&amp;#39;s try this.\u201d says Ariel, uncertain but unreluctant. The space within the ring of fire emplodes, blasting everything within a block from the alley into ash, ember and flame and causing a blinding flash of light...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...The year is 1999, and the mysterious woman wakes up. The woman, slowly getting up, looks around, not aware of her whereabouts, the time, not even the year. As she looks around she notices a pool of blood in the middle of the brown carpet. She gets up disoriented, to go look in the bathroom mirror. She notices a faint scar on her forehead. She sees behind her a clock on the bedroom nightstand, saying 3:00 A.M. She looks back at herself, and smiles...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
