But the mother of the Hare's wife was also a very pretty woman. One day she went to visit her daughter and Hare fell in love. His desire grew stronger every day, so he began to find out what to do in order to sleep with her. He watched the movements of the mother-in-law carefully and discovered first of all that she was very fond of basking in the sun. Every morning when the sun was sweet she would come out of the house and bask until it was time to eat the afternoon meal. The second thing that Hare discovered was that his mother-in-law always sat on the same spot. \nOne day very very early in the morning Hare went to that spot and scooped out the sand, put himself in the hole and covered himself so carefully that it was impossible to notice that there was anything unusual. Then when the sun has become sweet the mother-in-law came out of the house and went and sat in the exact same spot. \nThat day the sun was extremely sweet, and Hare's mother-in-law enjoyed it very much. She did not sit as usual, but moved about, now up and down, now sideways. O she moved a great deal and sweated and made sounds of enjoyment. Hare's mother-in-law enjoyed herself very deeply. \nIn the evening when the people were sitting around the evening fire a small piece of gourd began jumping up and down and singing the following song very softly:\n\nPengle-pengle-pengle-pengle.\n\nPengle-pengle-pengle-pengle. \n\nO Hare and his mother-in-law pengle,\n\nDid a certain thing very sweet, pengle,\n\nNuk-nuk-kanuk-kanuk nukere,\n\nNuk-nuk-kanuk-kanuk nukere.\n\nOnly Hare heard the soft song of the piece of gourd, so he took it in his hand and walked to the end of the swept compound and threw it very hard. But the piece of gourd flew zigzag through the air and came back to the fireplace and began to jump up and down and to sing more loudly:\n\nPengle-pengle-pengle-pengle.\n\nHare seized the piece of gourd and went into the house. He put it into a mortar and pounded it into powder. Then he put the powder into water and drank it up. \nWhen he came back to the fireplace someone asked him: 'Hare,what is wrong with you?'\n'Nothing, nothing, I am fine, very fine,' He replied. \nHare sat with the people around the fire until his stomach made a loud noise, and then he felt like defecating.

This memeless void wasn\u2019t like that. There was light, gases, matter, all the basic stuff you find in simple dimensions. There were planets, grass, people. The void wasn\u2019t empty, just memeless. There were gods, cities, countries, and creatures. Almost everything that is in the known universe. Men fought. Wars waged. It only lacked memes.\n\nHermes, the god of mischief was pursuing his realm one fine day. He passed the Pillars of Creation, Neptune, and then came upon Earth. \u2018*Ah, home.\u2019* Hermes thought. He landed down on the rocky planet. He walked aimlessly taking in the earthy air. He let his fingers run through the tall grass, feeling every blade, every cell. \n\n\u201cWah!\u201d a nearby voice spoke.\n\nHermes was confused. He believed that he had heard every sound of every creature on Earth.\n\n\u201cHello?\u201d Hermes asked.\n\n\u201cWah.\u201d It spoke back.\n\nHermes parted some grass and his eyes fell upon a blob of living fat. It had eyes, a mouth, a nose. It had tiny hands and feet that were barely visible, tucked away by the fat. It looked around, seemingly confused, taking in its surroundings.\n\n\u201cWah?\u201d It said.\n\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d Hermes asked the living blob.\n\n\u201cGlarbo!\u201d It said.\n\n\u201cGlarbo? Who created you? Was Zeus drunk again?\u201d Hermes said. Glarbo twitched with excitement.\n\n\u201cBoy, I don\u2019t know.\u201d Glarbo said.\n\n\u201cAre you lost, Glarbo?\u201d Hermes asked the strange creature. Glarbo glanced around for whoever said his name.\n\n\u201cMaybe.\u201d Glarbo said, unsure.\n\nHermes picked up Glarbo and held him in his hands. Hermes started to run and came upon the closest village. Hermes made sure to disguise himself before he came into the village.\n\n\u201cHello, peasants! Have you seen this creature before?\u201d Hermes asked, disguised as a wizard.\n\n\u201cWhy, yes! That\u2019s Glarbo! Don\u2019t you know Glarbo? Who doesn\u2019t know Glarbo?\u201d The peasant said. \n\n\u201cWhy was he out in a field?\u201d Hermes asked.\n\n\u201cWe exiled him.\u201d A blacksmith chimed in.\n\n\u201cWhy would you exile this Glarbo? He seems harmless enough. Look at his tiny hands! He\u2019s physically incapable of hurting an insect with them! Just look at his hands!\u201d Hermes said.\n\n\u201cOh, really? He broke 7 of my pots in one day because he thought I said his name.\u201d The potter said.\n\n\u201cHe squished half my loaves of bread one day for the same reason.\u201d The baker said.\n\n\u201cThis tiny creature did all that?\u201d Hermes said.\n\n\u201cHe can do things some might say are impossible.\u201d A farmer said.\n\n\u201cEver seen a fly trying to get out of a house? He\u2019s like that but worse and breaks all your stuff.\u201d The peasant said.\n\nHermes put Glarbo down on the ground because he was getting a little fidgety.\n\n\u201cJust say something that remotely sounds like his name.\u201d The blacksmith said.\n\n\u201cHarbor.\u201d Hermes said.\n\n\u201cWah!\u201d Glarbo yelled. He sprung forward hitting a cow, tipping over a bottle of wine, hitting a merchant in the back of the head, bounced off and landed on top of Hermes head.\n\n\u201cSee?\u201d The blacksmith said.\n\n\u201cWell maybe you can make a deal with him.\u201d Hermes said,\n\n\u201cHa! A deal? With Glarbo? What a joke!\u201d The blacksmith laughed.\n\n\u201cCome, Glarbo.\u201d Hermes said. Glarbo jumped into Hermes\u2019 hands and they walked off. As Hermes and Glarbo walked throughout the streets of this village he noticed that not once did he see someone smiling. Not even a grin, nor a smirk! It was a humorless village.\n\n\u201cGlarbo, all these people are so boring. No one\u2019s laughing.\u201d Hermes whispered to Glarbo.\n\n\u201cI can make \u2018em laugh, just you see.\u201d Glarbo said. He bounced off of Hermes\u2019 hands and grabbed a piece of paper from a printing press and hopped towards an author and stole his pencil.\n\n\u201cGlarbo!\u201d Multiple voices yelled. Tomatoes were thrown. Apples chucked. Rocks pelted. Hermes had to shield Glarbo. Glarbo was drawing something. It was a crude drawing of a man. His hands were in the air and he said one word. \u201cFarbus.\u201d He showed it to a nearby potter and he laughed so hard he almost choked. \n\n\u201cWah! See?\u201d Glarbo gloated.\n\n\u201cAh, I see. Farbus\u201d Hermes said, dumbfounded.\n\nGlarbo made another copy of the Farbus drawing and drew 5 more, and 10 more and 20 more until he had a thick pile of Farbus drawings. Glarbo jumped around the village and stuck the drawings to walls and doors. He jumped around handing them to people he landed on. Within 5 seconds the whole village erupted in laughter. \n\n\u201cHa, Farbus! So original! Please make more of these!\u201d A peasant said.\n\n\u201cHmm, Glarbo, you\u2019re pretty good at this.\u201d Hermes said.\n\n\u201cYes, If I am going to make more I will have to name them something. How about, memes. Yes, memes, what a great name.\u201d\n\n***The end***. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Book 2*\n\n The Holy Glibble\n\nOn 10/29, 1029 BC Glarbo invented memes. Everybody seeked to create the same high quality memes as Glarbo. Pewdiepie tried. Scarce tried. Keemstar tried. None of them were capable of creating high quality memes like Glarbo. Glarbo was the only one. \n\nThe Pews under the guidance of Pewdiepie waged war against the Scarces and the Keems. This war started on the 100 year anniversary of the creation of memes.\n\nPeople attempted to rise to the same level as Glarbo through meme practices and religion. People worshipped Glarbo. Some hated him. Some wanted to be him. Thus began the Great Meme War.\n\nThe Keems stole the the Sacred Meme Texts out from under Glarbo's watchful eye. This angered Glarbo. \u201cWahhh!\u201d he screamed. He sent out on a journey for the Sacred Meme Texts.\n\nGlarbo disguised himself as a slightly more human version of himself. His new, human name was Glarbodysseus. He passed through human villages torn apart by the Great Meme War. He was disappointed. *Memes are supposed to bring people together, not tear them apart.* Glarbo was saddened. Memes brought people together for generations, for decades. Memes were a symbol of peace.\n\nGlarbo came upon a dark and dank forest. He walked through the forest and heard a great noise. \n\n\u201cBobo wants a corner! Bobo! Bobo wants a corner!\u201d \n\n*What is this beautiful singing?* Glarbo thought. \n\nHe felt himself being drawn toward the sound. He found the source. A herd of Bobos. Bobos are dangerous because once you get close enough they will eat you. Glarbo knew this and flew away.\n\nGlarbo used his powerful mind to erect a great boat in the Gringer Bay. He set off through the sunset. His eyes fell upon devastated cities, destroyed by man\u2019s greed. Glarbo could not understand. How could something so beautiful turn so ugly? How? He came upon an island. Sklunkus Island. \n\nHe witnessed men fighting. He saw Pews. He saw Scarces. He saw Keems.\n\n\u201cFellas, I gotta keep it real with you. I am disappointed. You turned a symbol of peace into a symbol of yearning. Memes are studied. Not acquired. Memes are learned. Not bought. Do you understand? Hand over the Sacred Meme Texts.\u201d Glarbo said.\n\nThe Pews handed over the Sacred Meme Texts. Glarbo took them and gave them all a stern look. They all broke down crying.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re sorry! We\u2019re sorry!\u201d the men yelled.\n\nGlarbo flew away to his abode.\n\n***The end.***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "author_fullname": "t2_20fydyqo", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "The Farbiverse: So Far (Books, 1, and 2 (3 is being written)).", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/stories", "hidden": false, "pwls": null, "link_flair_css_class": "purple", "downs": 0, "parent_whitelist_status": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_9rqd0n", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2, "domain": "self.stories", "media_embed": {}, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Fiction", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 2, "approved_by": null, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1540631025.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "contest_mode": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Farbiverse was created on the basis that memes are important, that memes hold a place in the world.

change the way we think throughout the day, it\u2019s as if we\u2019re on a train, the train is our eyes, as we as passengers are the minds, the trains focus on the stops, where to move to next, which way to move, and where the next destination shall be. just like our eyes. we chose what to look at, and decide what to look at next, however we tend to lose focus. like passengers on a train, whether we sit or stand, whether we read or write, or decide to listen to music, whether we socialize with the people we decide to share our thoughts with, we all do one thing.. we come to lose focus of our surroundings, what we are being shown no longer matters, the position in which we are placed in that moment becomes nothing. our mind will always be the passengers, moving in the direction our eyes are taking us, though we are never in the present, but time unknown, time known only to ones self. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null,

December 18th 2017 when I first heard her voice. I was playing Overwatch with my friend David who lives in Nebraska(knew him for a year or so at the time) which was basically the norm for us at the time. Now, David is the type of guy to act all independent but in reality, he really just likes to ride anyone's dick as long as he thinks they are cool. So on this day, he invites a girl to our play station party (not gonna put her username for privacy reasons). I find out her name is Sarah, she lives in Florida, used to date David a while back (they met in minecraft like 5 years ago), has a shit ton of mental illnesses, and is in a relationship she feels stuck in with a guy from Utah.\n\nOf course, being a teenager I was thirsty for some gamer girl coochie so I go ahead and try to do my best to be seductive which, to be honest, just consisted of me spamming \"I love you\" every minute or two. Surprisingly enough, David encouraged my advances. All 3 of us played Overwatch together for a couple weeks. Eventually one night, David said that Sarah would send me booty pics if I send him a photo of me(he's never seen my face). Me, not being an idiot, decided to agree to that. Once David sees my face he insists that I'm actually really attractive and that he should show Sarah. She loses her shit. I'm talking to the point where she is almost squealing because she thinks I am so cute. In the end, I did get those booty pics and god damn my bois. her body is an easy 8 to 9/10. Definitely someone I could see myself wanting to do shit with you know?\n\nThe day after she starts to show a whole lot more affection (not that I'm complaining). She claims she really does like me but she can't because shes with that guy from Utah. I learn his name is Tyler and that they've been talking for about 7 to 8 years. They've been a thing for a while but it's always been on and off. She sends me a picture of Tyler and holy fuck is he ugly. He looks like he is 5'2, had terrible, ugly blonde hair, and had about as much muscle as a baby. Not to mention he would always treat Sarah like shit daily and was all around a bad guy. I ask Sarah why shes even with this guy in the first place. It's not like he's good for her. She says it's because they've known each other for so long that it's hard to let go. When I hear that, my heart drops. I mean, it made no sense.\n\nNothing made sense. Why did she leave? Why did I even have feelings? I just started talking to her a week or so ago. I mean, she had a boyfriend, but I still cared for her. So I did what felt right. I told her straight up that Tyler is bad for her, does nothing but hurt her and takes her for granted and she agrees but it doesn't change anything. Me and Sarah would talk more and more as time passes. David hated it and to this day I still have no idea why. I have to assume he was jealous, but in retrospect, why would he be jealous. If anything he should've been worried for me.\n\nMe and Sarah would sext and shit from time to time and one day I went out and said, \"look babe, I wanna be with you, I really do. But if we're gonna be a thing, Tyler needs to go.\" And she made it happen. Just like that, she left Tyler for me. It almost felt too easy but she would send screenshots of Tyler trying to apologize and come back to her. Looking back on it, I feel bad for the guy.\n\nBut just like that, in the December of 2017 I got my early Christmas present in the form a girlfriend that I would grow to love, hate, and never forget.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHey so I hope you enjoyed if you read this far, I do plan on finishing this story. This was more or less just the setup, but I do intend to take my time with this, sorry if it's really long. I broke it into parts to make it more easily digestible. I plan on posting a new part everyday sometime in the afternoon. I hope you guys look forward to it. :)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-Sean", "author_fullname": "t2_4u9asqa", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Sarah's story part 1/?", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/stories", "hidden": false, "pwls": null, "link_flair_css_class": "red", "downs": 0, "parent_whitelist_status": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_9rhkku", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4, "domain": "self.stories", "media_embed": {}, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Non-Fiction", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 4, "approved_by": null, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1540556547.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "contest_mode": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The first encounter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The date was December 18th 2017 when I first heard her voice.

Enjoy, or don't.\n\nThe Child waited anxiously by the door, like a dog \nawaiting it\u2019s owners return. He sat there, fidgeting, waiting. As the door opened, he bolted toward it, and jumped at the Man when he walked into view. \u201cDad!\u201d the Child yelled as the Man caught him in his arms; then it all went black.\n\n\nThe Man jerked awake, and his eyes darted around the room, searching for the family that wasn\u2019t there. His expression sullied as he remembered they were gone. The Man walked down the long road east; cars littered it like leaves on a lawn in autumn, some blackened from fire. The silence, while calming to most, was unsettling to the Man. Silence only meant the man was alone to his thoughts, and in his state, none of them were good. The Man continued down the road.\n\n\nThe Child told the Man of the things he did when the Man was away; stories of new friends, things learned at his first year at school, and the time the Man missed. The Mother congratulated the Child on his achievements. The Child noticed the Man staring off into the distance. The Child tried to get his attention, first saying his name, then shaking him. The Man snapped back into reality with a scream louder than the Child had ever heard, then it all went black.\n\n\nThe Man bolted upright, screaming,with eyes zipping around like a fly trapped inside a room. He calmed down and noticed his fire dwindling. He got up and walked into the dark of night, in search of the fuel he needed. The Man, busy gathering the fuel, heard a crack in the bushes nearby. Before he had the chance to react, he felt cold steel against the nape of his neck, and heard the familiar click he knew all too well.\n\n\nThe Man was laid in bed with his wife, discussing the crisis forming around the world. The Mother then changed the subject to the events that occured at dinner. All the Man could think in that moment was how his mattress felt like a marshmallow in comparison to what he was used to. The Man\u2019s attention returned back to the conversation when the Mother waved her hand in front of his face; he looked shocked for a second, and then resumed with the conversation. It quickly turned into an argument over what had happened over dinner. \u201cWhat if I do something worse?\u201d the Man asks his wife. \u201cYou just need to readjust to life here,\u201d she said in attempt to calm him down. \u201cWhat will I do in the meantime while I\u2019m \u2018readjusting?\u201d he continued. \u201cWhy can\u2019t you just take him to the park? I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be fine,\u201d she replied, in an attempt to reaffirm him by rubbing his shoulder. \u201cBut he was terrified of me from what happened at dinner.\u201d. The Man\u2019s face saddened as the words left his lips. \u201cHe is your son, he will never be terrified of you.\u201d. \u201cAlright, I\u2019ll give it a shot.\u201d. A faint smile finally appeared across his stressed face as he begrudgingly agreed. It all went black.\n\n\n\u201cHands behind your head!\u201d the Gunman ordered, pressing the barrel of the gun harder against the Man\u2019s head. \u201cSteady now, be calm,\u201d The Man said, raising his hands. \u201c I\u2019m the one with the gun, I make the orders,\u201d the Gunman said as he walked around to face the Man. \u201cWhat\u2019s in the bag?\u201d the Gunman demanded. \u201cNothing you need,\u201d the Man answered. \u201cI didn\u2019t ask if I needed it, give it to me\u201d the Gunman ordered. \u201cI can\u2019t do that,\u201d the Man said, his hands balling into fists. \u201cDo I look like I care about what you can\u2019t do? Give me the bag, now!\u201d. The Gunman\u2019s hands shook as he yelled. As the Gunman pressed the gun barrel against the Man\u2019s head, a large crack echoes in the distance. As the Gunman\u2019s attention left the situation at hand for the briefest of moments, the Man took the chance he had been waiting for. He grabbed the barrel of the gun, and ripped it from the Gunman\u2019s grasp.\n\n\nThe Man stood over the Gunman. He almost didn\u2019t recall doing it; muscle memory, as grim as it may be, was true. He was used to it. The Man looked into the Gunman\u2019s eyes, glossy now, but still terrified. The Man checked the Gunman\u2019s pockets, and to his surprise, found the Gunman\u2019s wallet. Opening it, he found something that only pushed him further back into the dark.\n\n\nThe Man sat at a bench, and watched his son play with other children. The manic running reminded him of his past, although this was less violent. He pushed the thought out of his mind. The Man joined his son in play; he chased him, carried him on his shoulders, and pushed him on the swings. Every time the Man went away, he lost months of watching his son grow up. This last time, he lost a year. The Man then saw something in the distance that finally pushed him past his limit. The Man watched closely as a new group of children joined them in play. As they ran towards his son, they pulled something out of their pockets: cap guns. In the Man\u2019s head, they were no toys. He jumped up and ran to his shield his son from the impending threat. The last thing he remembered was the black returning to consume him.\n\nAs the Man finished digging the Gunman\u2019s grave, he hoped they weren\u2019t around to miss him. He caught his thoughts before they left his head. He found them disgusting, and wondered what had brought him to this place inside his head. The Man wedged the photo of the Gunman\u2019s family into the makeshift cross, right before walking off into the dark of the night.\n\n\nThe Man reluctantly said goodbye to his family. They didn\u2019t know if they would ever see him again. Tears streamed from the Child\u2019s eyes like a river as he begged and pleaded for the Man not to leave. But the Man had his duty; he had to serve. The Man kissed the Mother, opened the door, and walked into the black.\n\n\nThe Man started approaching his house. As he neared it, he saw that half of it had been \u00a0scorched as black as coal. He stepped toward the house with caution. He didn\u2019t want the question that had lingered in his head for so long to be answered, even though he knew what it would be. The Man opened the door, and walked into the black.\n\n\nThe Man argued over the crisis with the Mother. She said the riots there were too much, and that she needed him home. The Man could hear it in her voice; the fear, as well as the noise outside, the yelling, the glass breaking. The Child told his father he was scared to come home, and he begged and pleaded to the Man to protect them. He knew he had to help them, but he also thought about how long it would take to get there. Across the country felt like across the world at this point, but it was his only option. Suddenly, he heard the door break. The Mother told the child to hide. The last thing the Man said to his family is that he promised he would find them, and that he would make their family whole again. The last thing he heard was his family\u2019s screams, right before seeing a blinding flash of light. The screen went black.\n\n\nHe found his answer in their bedroom. He couldn\u2019t even recognize them, burnt and mutilated, but he saw the wedding band on her finger. He had failed them. He wished he\u2019d never left, \u00a0and he felt something he hadn\u2019t felt in a long time. Tears flowed down his face. He buried his family in the three holes he dug. He thought constantly of the time he spent with his family; the fighting, the leaving, the happy times. His last thought was of when he brought his son to the park to play. With their picture held against his forehead, he placed the barrel of the gun in his mouth, the cold steel scraping against his teeth . His last tear rolled down his face as he pulled the trigger. It all went black...\n\n\nThe Child looked back into the distance. The sound, while not unfamiliar to him, sounded lonesome and distant, yet still, he found it hold his attention. The sudden noise felt like it meant something to him. The Child saw smoke rising from his old town, his home, like steam rising from his plate at dinner. The Child\u2019s attention snapped forward again as The Mother took his arm, pulling him away. \u201cWe have to leave, home isn\u2019t safe anymore. We have to go find your Father.\u201d She said. They started walking their long walk, into the black.\n\n\n", "author_fullname": "t2_3puu8w5", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Long Walk Off a Short Pier", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/stories", "hidden": false, "pwls": null, "link_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "parent_whitelist_status": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_9rem4d", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1, "domain": "self.stories", "media_embed": {}, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": null, "can_mod_post": false, "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1540532394.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "contest_mode": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a story I wrote a while back for school, I was just interested it people&amp;#39;s thoughts of it.

I wanted to fall back to sleep so badly but I knew I had to be at NASA in about an hour for some mysterious meeting that I was called for. I go to my shower and say the words \u201cpower on\u201d and my shower turns on automatically. After my shower, I eat two pieces of toast and rush to my car. Traffic was fairly easy probably because it was a Saturday and nobody hardly worked on a Saturday. When I got to NASA I met with the head of command, his name is Richard Simmons and he immediately told me to sit down in a chair. He went over a plan that was kind of mind-boggling that it made me kind of nervous. It was called Osiris 1 and it was a space mission to the Andromeda galaxy. He wanted me to do the mission because I was one of the best pilots in the world at the time. \u201cDaniel I know it\u2019s a lot but I need you to trust me on this mission, if everything goes well you should be on a new planet in less than 200 years\u201d he said. 200 years? I won\u2019t be able to see my family ever again if I do this mission. I know you are upset but you are only hope to explore this new planet, if you go your family will be well taken care of while you\u2019re gone he said. Why are you willing to waste resources on a planet that is 1 to 2 light years away? Our planet is not going to survive the next 300 years. Water level is rising do to the poles melting and food is running short he refuted. Ever since the mars 2050 mission, NASA wanted to visit the far reaches of our solar system because earth\u2019s natural resources were depleting. In 2080 men built a space station outside the orbit of Pluto the mission was funded by the U.S government and ever since then NASA has flown multiple missions to deliver supplies. How long until we take off? \u201cGive or take 6 months \u201c. I accepted the mission but on one condition, I needed to be given the Medal of Honor when I came home. I knew this wasn\u2019t going to be easy telling my dad, he was already dealing with the loss of my mom. My mom passed away when a car slid off the road and smashed head on into her. I miss her and so does my dad, that\u2019s why I can\u2019t tell him immediately. I wasn\u2019t informed until the months leading up to the mission that a girl would be joining me. Her name on the letter said Emily Walker, she was an exemplary pilot she had flown a couple of missions to Pluto and back. She was also intelligent, she graduated from Harvard with a 4.2. When I felt like it was the right time I went to my dad\u2019s home to tell him the news about the mission. I noticed right away that he was on the verge of tears and I can\u2019t blame him losing your whole family to events like these is definitely upsetting. I comforted him for the next 6 months until the launch. I got a call from NASA on July 6th telling me that I needed to meet them for a briefing. There I got to meet Emily my co-pilot, my first impressions with her were great. Richard told me that when I got to the planet I needed to deploy a beacon that would send a signal back to NASA. He also told me the name of the planet \u201cvector 1b\u201d. It was finally launch day, the air felt humid and the air was blowing rather heavily. We both were loaded on the ship and were put into hyper sleep pods. All I remember hearing the doctor counting backwards from 100. When she got to 50 I woke up and remember seeing Emily\u2019s pod on the other side of me. I pulled the emergency lever to get out and not even 5 minutes later Emily is out of her pod gasping for air. I went to go see what instructions was left for us, I found\n\na message on the main console of the ship it read that there was enough food to last for 3 months and that we needed to maintain the ships integrity until we land. We both ate packets of food when we got out because we were both starving. And while we were eating we both got to know each other better. I asked her things like what was her hobbies back on earth? She answered with drawing and writing. She also asked me what my favorite hobbies were and I said that I loved to work on technology. Emily pulled up the location of the ship while I went to check for damages. Luckily no parts were damaged and the ship still had plenty of backup fuel to make it to vector 1b. The rest of the flight I got to know Emily so well. We would talk about our childhood experiences, our dreams growing up and our goals for when we get to the new planet. She said when she gets to this new planet she wants to find the best garden and she wants to also find life. Finally, the planet comes into our vision and we see that it\u2019s almost identical to earth but it has different shaped continents.

I wanted to fall back to sleep so badly but I knew I had to be at NASA in about an hour for some mysterious meeting that I was called for. I go to my shower and say the words \u201cpower on\u201d and my shower turns on automatically. After my shower, I eat two pieces of toast and rush to my car. Traffic was fairly easy probably because it was a Saturday and nobody hardly worked on a Saturday. When I got to NASA I met with the head of command, his name is Richard Simmons and he immediately told me to sit down in a chair. He went over a plan that was kind of mind-boggling that it made me kind of nervous. It was called Osiris 1 and it was a space mission to the Andromeda galaxy. He wanted me to do the mission because I was one of the best pilots in the world at the time. \u201cDaniel I know it\u2019s a lot but I need you to trust me on this mission, if everything goes well you should be on a new planet in less than 200 years\u201d he said. 200 years? I won\u2019t be able to see my family ever again if I do this mission. I know you are upset but you are only hope to explore this new planet, if you go your family will be well taken care of while you\u2019re gone he said. Why are you willing to waste resources on a planet that is 1 to 2 light years away? Our planet is not going to survive the next 300 years. Water level is rising do to the poles melting and food is running short he refuted. Ever since the mars 2050 mission, NASA wanted to visit the far reaches of our solar system because earth\u2019s natural resources were depleting. In 2080 men built a space station outside the orbit of Pluto the mission was funded by the U.S government and ever since then NASA has flown multiple missions to deliver supplies. How long until we take off? \u201cGive or take 6 months \u201c. I accepted the mission but on one condition, I needed to be given the Medal of Honor when I came home.
