This story is pt 1 in a series my girlfriend Hannah has written. To be honest she doesn't know I'm posting this. She is very kind and Hubble and doesn't want admit her writing is really good. (mind you she's 14 and i'm 15). She hasn't finished editing this so if there are any errors its my fault not hers.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nScratches. Scissors. Mirror. Food. Disappointment. Broken.\n\nBy: Hannah\n\nThe day was like any other Friday morning in the middle of November, the grass was frosted over, and it was cold. I woke up that day and got ready how I usually did. At 6:50 in the morning my alarm goes off and I wake up. I would normally go back to sleep after I shut off that alarm but I forgot to shower the night before, so I got up to get my clothes. Thankfully, I was smart enough to set out my outfit for today before bed last night. As I pick up my clothes I stubbed my toe on the sliding rail for my closet doors. I dropped the F bomb. Something a 12 year old probably shouldn't have done.\n\n\u201cShoot, I hope my parents didn\u2019t hear that.\u201d I thought to myself after the pain went away. The walls in my house are very thin and my room is next to theirs.\n\nI walk over to my door and open it the rest of the way. As I do, I see my dogs glowing eyes reflecting the living room lights.\n\n\u201cWell that\u2019s not creepy, Lucky.\u201d I whispered and bent down to scratch him behind the ear. As I moved around him, I turned on the bathroom light and shut the door.\n\nI set my clothes on the counter next to the sink and brush my hair before getting into the shower. While in the shower I of course get soap in my left eye. Another F bomb was dropped. After frantically washing my eye out with water and washing my body, I turn off the shower and open the curtain. I reach for my towel that was hanging up on a rack next to the shower and dry off. Above the towel rack there is a clock and I squint to try and read the time, 7:05.\n\n\u201cGreat, I spent about 10 minutes in the shower because of my eye. I could have used those five extra minutes to watch Netflix or something.\u201d I thought and step onto the shower mat outside of the tub.\n\nAfter getting dressed and brushing my hair I open the bathroom door and walk out into the hallway, turning off the light behind me. I then walk down the hall and to the left where my bedroom is. I feel the wall to try and find the lightswitch because it was still dark outside. I flip it on after trying to find it for what seemed like forever, and put my night clothes into the laundry basket behind my door. I then walked like a zombie to my bed and unplug my phone.\n\n\u201c7:10, time to eat.\u201d I said and unlocked my phone. I then open Snapchat and send my streaks and open all my texts from last night after I fell asleep and this morning. I saw that Desi texted me;\n\n\u201cCan you bring me perfume please?\u201d\n\nI rolled my eyes and texted her back;\n\n\u201cSure, I\u2019ll also bring you a poptart.\u201d and hit send. Desi and I met my second school year in Ohio. The first month of 5th grade I didn't really know who I was and lost myself. Desi and I didn't get along at first, but after I found who I was we became good friends.\n\nI walked back out of my room and down the hall, Lucy, my other dog jumped off my parents bed then and followed me. I turned on the kitchen light and off the living room one. I next walk over to the cabinet where we keep our room temperature foods stored. Choosing the kind of cereal I wanted that day was easy. I hated Wheaties and the only other cereal that appealed to me there was Cheerios. I pick up the box and get a bowl from the a cabinet to the left of the sink. After pouring out the cereal and getting the milk I realized that I had a History test that day, great. I unhappily pour the milk into my bowl and  put the milk back in the fridge.  I got a spoon from the drawer under the microwave counter and sat down at the dinner table.\n\n\u201cWhy is it called a \u2018dinner table\u2019 if we eat a variety of meals here throughout the day and not just dinner?\u201d I thought  to myself as I dreadfully started to shovel my breakfast down. I pick up my phone that I set down on  the table and turn it on. 7:20.\n\nI then set an alarm for 7:50 on my phone and open Netflix to watch something while I ate. I have a bad habit of watching seven shows at once so I spent a few minutes trying to decide on what to watch. After some thought I clicked on \u201cThe Flash\u201d and finished the rest of the episode I was watching the night before. I had just enough time to finish the episode when my alarm went off. I got up and rinsed out my cereal bowl and put it in the dishwasher. While doing this I remembered the time I put Dawn dish soap in the dishwasher since we ran out of actual dishwasher soap. It overfload and there was soap all over the kitchen, coming out from all sides of the machine. I laugh to myself and walk down the hall and back to my room.\n\nI gather my school things and put them into my bag along with my perfume that smells like roses for Desi. Next I put on my socks and shoes then find a hoodie to wear. I have a thing about hoodies. I wear one almost every single day of the school year. They keep me warm and are just comforting in an emotional way. I pick one that\u2019s black with white lettering that reads \u201cJust Do You\u201d . It\u2019s already cold outside, I can feel it in the house. I look at the time again and it reads 7:55. I walk down the hallway and into the bathroom to brush my teeth. At first when I spit out the toothpaste I panicked, I quickly realized the scent and sight of blood was from me brushing my gums too roughly. I hate the smell of blood, it smells like rusting iron and mold. It makes me nauseous. I set down my tooth brush and wrap one arm around my stomach and use my other hand to cling to the edge of the sink.\n\n\u201cJust breathe and count to ten.\u201d I tell myself and after a few minutes I collect myself and feel better. I then pick up my phone and look at the time. \u201c8:05. Shit.\u201d\n\nI quickly throw my toothbrush back into the cabinet above the sink and walk out of the bathroom with my phone. I throw on my backpack on and walk to the end of the hall, to the door. I unlock it with a \u201cclink\u201d and open the door. The cold breeze of November breathes into my warm house. The smell of frost and snow make their way into my home. I close my eyes and breathe it in for a second. In that second everything else that was on my mind goes away.\n\nThat's the thing about nature with me. Whenever I look out of a window or smell the fresh air, my mind goes blank. It's the only time I'm not worrying about anyone or anything. It's enlightening in a way. A cat's paws hit the ground and makes a soft \u201cthud\u201d as it hits the snow. Cats love to sit on the wall outside of my house this time of year. I sigh and step outside, closing the door behind me. I look to the left and my moms car is in the driveway still.\n\n\u201cShe's going to be late again if she doesn't get up soon.\u201d I think to myself as the cat from before walks up to me. It\u2019s green eyes stare back at me as it rubs its jet black fur against my leg. I get my gloves from my backpack and put them on before I pet the cat. It purrs as I rub behind its ears for a while.\n\n\u201cHannah!\u201d I hear an all too familiar voice call out from a distance. Desi. I look up and she\u2019s waving me over from her house. Her hair is wet again and I recall all the times me and her would run into her house in the winter so our hair wouldn't freeze in the cold. I smile to myself on the thought and start to walk over to her. The cat follows me as I cross the road.\n\n\u201cHi, you might want to get into your house before your hair freezes again.\u201d I laugh and walk back with her to her house. Desi is the type of girl who\u2019s friends with a lot of people. Some of the people I don't particularly like, but she's a good person. I swear she eats drama for breakfast sometimes though.\n\n\u201cI have it in a bun, but you\u2019re right. It is kinda cold out and we both know I don't know what a coat is in the weather so let's go inside. The bus should be here in like 5 minutes.\u201d She replied and opened the door.\n\n\u201cDang Desi, do you not use a heater? It\u2019s colder in here then it is outside!\u201d I complain as I step into her house and prepare to be attacked by her dogs.\n\n\u201cThe dogs are in with my mom. We do use a heater but believe it or not it's actually warmer in here by one degree.\u201d Desi teases and sits down on her steps.\n\nShe tells me about some more drama between her and this girl I\u2019ve never met before. I told you she eats it for breakfast. The bus turns the corner then and we see it in her door window.\n\n\u201cOh thank goodness, the bus is here.\u201d I breathe and Desi laughs. She knows I don\u2019t care about the latest scandal in school.\n\nWe walk out of her house and into the cold again. She was right, her house is warmer then it is out here. We walk a few steps to the stop sign which is the bus stop and get onto the bus once it stops.\n\nThe smell of leather hits me as I step onto the bus and take my seat. Desi walks to the back where all of her friends who I don\u2019t like very much sit. We are the first ones on the bus in the morning so its quiet. I look out the window and lose track of time. My friend, Lea sits down next to me then.\n\n\u201cAre you okay dude, you look kinda depressed?\u201d She asks and sets her bag in her lap. Lea\u2019s the kind of person I can live with if I wanted to. We have a lot in common and like the same people. We mostly talk about some reality youtubers like Shane Dawson who is our favorite. Sometimes we talk about how we used to like anime and cringe at the fact that we went through that faze.\n\n\u201cYeah im okay.\u201d I reply, \u201cI just zoned out again I guess. How was your night?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was okay. I fell asleep at 7 again and didn't wake up until my alarm went off at 7:30. So I got a full 12 and a half hours of sleep. We both know I needed it though, I dont usually sleep much.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d I laugh. \u201cYou sure did get a lot more sleep then I did though. I didn't fall asleep until close to 4 this morning. I haven\u2019t been sleeping well again.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you think it\u2019s because of your gut feelings you've been getting recently?\u201d Lea asks as we turn the corner to the school.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, maybe.\u201d I say and think about the feelings I\u2019ve been getting again.\n\nMy mother, sister, father, grandma, and some more of my relatives all have seen some dead relatives. They don\u2019t look scary, but they see them in places like the coseno or their old house walking to the bathroom. I personally haven\u2019t seen anything like this before but I do get these feelings and visions in a way, like my dad. In the back of my mind throughout the day I see visions but I don't notice them until they happen. It\u2019s like the case of deja vu\u2019 but I\u2019ve seen the event happen before in my head. I don\u2019t understand why and it confuses me, but my dad gets the same thing sometimes.\n\nI also get these gut feelings when it comes to my sister or other important people in my life. I get the feeling in the pit of my stomach and my chest that something may happen soon. Whenever I get this feeling something does happen that day, three days later, or even a week later. I mostly get this feeling and then something happens with my sister. Sometimes though, something happens to my other family members like my grandma for instance. Once I got this gut feeling about my grandma and two days later she tripped and hurt her ankle while walking down the stairs.\n\nWe pull into the school parking lot then and into the bus lane.\n\n\u201cTime for prison.\u201d I joked and got off the bus which was now loud with verious chatter.\n\nWalking into school I hear the bell ring and the sound of people opening and shutting their lockers. I walk up the stairs located in the main lobby and to mine. Both people who are next to me just left to walk to homeroom so I have more space. The lockers at my school are small. Some are the size of an old square box t.v but mine is probably the size of a tall and thin cd rack. I get out my locker key from my backpack and unlock my locker. I cannot work a combination lock to save my life. I open my locker and stuff my bag into it as best as I could. I then open the cubby at the top of it by flicking a little metal bar inside of the main part of the locker. I grab my notebooks for science, history, and english, along with my pencil bag and book. I was reading \u201cThe Tale of Despereaux\u201d for the hundredth time. Something about the book just speaks to me, maybe it\u2019s the happy ending.\n\nI close my both parts of my locker and start to walk to homeroom. I work my way down the hall, down the stairs, and to the right where Mrs.Gill greats me.\n\n\u201cGood morning!\u201d She smiles and I smile in agnolishment. Mrs.Gill is nice and can make homeroom and first period fun sometimes. Homeroom and first period went was dragged on like always. All I usually do is sit there and read. After an hour and a half a book can get a bit boring if you don't take breaks. Mrs.Gill didn\u2019t have anything fun to show us that day so nothing important happened. I pretty much finished my book before the bell rang for second period.\n\nThat\u2019s when it started to happen. As I walked down the halls, I started to notice how pretty everyone is, even on a day like Monday.\n\n\u201cWow, I\u2019m really not all that good looking.\u201d I thought to myself for what seemed like the tenth time in my life. Everyone has days where they don\u2019t feel good about themselves, but this day was the first day I took it in deep.\n\nThat\u2019s all I thought about for the rest of the day. Second period went by like a blur, Ms.Hobz just had us do book work for our upcoming science test that Friday. I didn\u2019t eat lunch that day, I just took it out of my bag and threw it away. Food disgusted me.\n\n\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you eating anything, Hannah?\u201d My friend Abbi asked me.\n\n\u201cNot hungry.\u201d I said and just lied my head down. I was.\n\nAbbi was one of my closest friends at the time. We could write a paragraph about what one of us were thinking about just by looking at each others faces. She was always there for me, but she also has self-confidence issues so I didn't bring up mine with her. I knew better than to talk about my issues with her. She always found a way to make them about herself.\n\nFourth period rolled around and that\u2019s when I\u2019d almost always fall asleep. I can\u2019t help that no one talks so it\u2019s always quiet in my History class. My teacher, Mrs.John hated it, but it was nice to have a relaxing class. I like history, it\u2019s an easier subject to learn unlike science and math. I got called on twice to answer questions, I hate being called on. The spotlight is not for me. I luckily knew the answers to both questions. I usually do, I just don\u2019t want to answer.\n\nFifth period had my favorite teacher, Mr.Scall. He was my english teacher and always nagged me about not writing enough. He still does to this day. I can be walking down the hall to third period and he\u2019ll stop me and say,\n\n\u201cHannah! You don\u2019t write enough.\u201d\n\nI\u2019d say something along the lines of \u201cYes, I know Mr.Scall.\u201d and walk to third.\n\nThat day we were presenting our monologues to the class. Me and my friend Natasha decided to to act out a skit about *Shark Tank*. Our prop was a zombie toy and I was one of the sharks. Natasha was presenting her item (the toy) to me and in the end, after we made the deal she said it was a fake. The class loved our act, but I still hate presenting things to this day.\n\nSixth period came and I walked to math class with Ms.Po. Sixth period was the only class I absolutely hated. The people there were always so wound up and always gave Ms.Po a hard time. There were only six people  in the class out of 15 that she actually could rely on to complete the work. Me of course, being one of them. People always say I throw myself into my work, it\u2019s true. It keeps me from thinking bad about myself.\n\nThankfully, sixth period went by fast and the bell rang. I walked to my locker and looked at the ground for the most part. I didn\u2019t want to see anyone\u2019s pretty faces again. I unlock my locker and open the cubby at the top again to put my books in it. I then grab my backpack and check my phone. Five miss calls from mom.\n\n\u201cGreat.\u201d I say to myself as the people beside me open their lockers.\n\nI put my phone in my hoodie pocket and put on my backpack straps. I next shut my locker and walked down the hall to my friend Alanna\u2019s locker.\n\nAlanna is my second best friend. I honestly like her more than Abbi for some pretty obvious reasons. She\u2019s more humble and Abbi always tried so hard to make everything about her. Alanna on the other hand, doesn\u2019t talk about herself enough. I worry about her. She always had her blonde hair up in a bun or a ponytail. She mostly wears hoodies, like me and sweatpants. We both prefer to be comfortable over stylish.\n\n\u201cHey.\u201d\n\n\u201cHey.\u201d She replies and shuts her locker. We walk down the hall and down the stairs to exit the school building.\n\n\u201cHow was your day?\u201d I asked as we walked over to the tree in the front of the building to wait for our rides to get there. The grounds in front of the building look so much bigger when there are people on almost every inch of it. Great, more pretty faces to look at.\n\n\u201cIt was good. Ms.Hob\u2019s class was fun.\u201d Alanna replies. She starts to talk about what they did but I wasn\u2019t paying attention. That\u2019s when I saw him. He was standing just a few feet in front of me talking to some of the people who ride my bus. I didn\u2019t recognize him until now but, he rides my bus too. For a second it seemed like time had frozen. Everything around me that was still, it\u2019s like the Earth shifted and everything that needed to be balanced, was.\n\n\u201cHannah?\u201d A distant voice calls and it snaps me back to reality.\n\n\u201cHannah! Your bus is here! Hello?\u201d Alanna shouts and I blink at her blakely. I look at her and back at him getting on the bus and I swear I could see him smiling and shaking his head at me.\n\n\u201cWhat is this witchcraft?\u201d I laugh to myself.\n\n\u201cUm, what?\u201d Alanna asks confused. \u201cNevermind, just get on the bus before it leaves you behind.\u201d\n\nI turned and started walking to my bus, in what seemed like autopilot.  I couldn\u2019t think straight as I sat down next to Lea on the bus.\n\n\u201cDude, what happened? You look actually shooketh.\u201d  Lea asks, concerned.\n\n\u201cNothing.\u201d I assure all to quickly, even for me. \u201c I um\u2026 I\u2019ll text you later about it,\u201d I say trying to recover from my quick reply.\n\n\u201cOkay?\u201d Lea says and puts in her ear buds to listen to music.\n\nI did the same and halfway through the bus ride home, I open my eyes that where apparently closed. A reaction to his voice I heard yelling out of one of the bus windows.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re smoking cancer sticks!\u201d He calls out to people who are walking down the sidewalks.\n\nI smile and shake my head. \u201cWhat is his name?\u201d\n\n\u201cJacob!\u201d Mr.Jo calls, \u201cSit down and cut that out before you cause me to crash this bus.\u201d\n\n\u201cJacob.\u201d I think to myself, smiling as I shake my head.\n\n\u201cOh, you wouldn\u2019t do that Mr.Jo!\u201d Jacob replies smiling, as he shuts the window and heads back to his seat.\n\nI can\u2019t help but listen to the conversations on the bus the rest of the ride home. Almost everyone had gotten off the bus by the time I put my earbuds away.\n\n\u201cBye Lea.\u201d I say as I move out of her way so she can get off of the bus.\n\n\u201cBye, my dude.\u201d She calls back and starts to walk home.\n\nEveryone who sits in the back of the bus then moves up to the front for the last two stops. The bus driver turns the corner to mine and Desi\u2019s bus stop and we stand up to get off.\n\n\u201cBye Desi, bye Hannah.\u201d Jacob says as we walk off the bus.\n\n\u201cBye.\u201d Desi laughs and starts to walk home.\n\nI couldn\u2019t say anything back. I was afraid I\u2019d choke if I tried.\n\n\u201cHow does he know my name?\u201d I  whisper to myself as I walk home on the sidewalk. I look up to see my dogs in the window wagging their tails. They start to bark as I open the mailbox to get the mail.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks aging for reading this.

Broken.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By: Hannah&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The day was like any other Friday morning in the middle of November, the grass was frosted over, and it was cold. I woke up that day and got ready how I usually did. At 6:50 in the morning my alarm goes off and I wake up. I would normally go back to sleep after I shut off that alarm but I forgot to shower the night before, so I got up to get my clothes. Thankfully, I was smart enough to set out my outfit for today before bed last night. As I pick up my clothes I stubbed my toe on the sliding rail for my closet doors. I dropped the F bomb. Something a 12 year old probably shouldn&amp;#39;t have done.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cShoot, I hope my parents didn\u2019t hear that.\u201d I thought to myself after the pain went away. The walls in my house are very thin and my room is next to theirs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I walk over to my door and open it the rest of the way. As I do, I see my dogs glowing eyes reflecting the living room lights.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWell that\u2019s not creepy, Lucky.\u201d I whispered and bent down to scratch him behind the ear. As I moved around him, I turned on the bathroom light and shut the door.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I set my clothes on the counter next to the sink and brush my hair before getting into the shower. While in the shower I of course get soap in my left eye. Another F bomb was dropped. After frantically washing my eye out with water and washing my body, I turn off the shower and open the curtain. I reach for my towel that was hanging up on a rack next to the shower and dry off. Above the towel rack there is a clock and I squint to try and read the time, 7:05.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cGreat, I spent about 10 minutes in the shower because of my eye. I could have used those five extra minutes to watch Netflix or something.\u201d I thought and step onto the shower mat outside of the tub.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After getting dressed and brushing my hair I open the bathroom door and walk out into the hallway, turning off the light behind me. I then walk down the hall and to the left where my bedroom is. I feel the wall to try and find the lightswitch because it was still dark outside. I flip it on after trying to find it for what seemed like forever, and put my night clothes into the laundry basket behind my door. I then walked like a zombie to my bed and unplug my phone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201c7:10, time to eat.\u201d I said and unlocked my phone. I then open Snapchat and send my streaks and open all my texts from last night after I fell asleep and this morning. I saw that Desi texted me;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cCan you bring me perfume please?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I rolled my eyes and texted her back;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cSure, I\u2019ll also bring you a poptart.\u201d and hit send. Desi and I met my second school year in Ohio. The first month of 5th grade I didn&amp;#39;t really know who I was and lost myself. Desi and I didn&amp;#39;t get along at first, but after I found who I was we became good friends.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I walked back out of my room and down the hall, Lucy, my other dog jumped off my parents bed then and followed me. I turned on the kitchen light and off the living room one. I next walk over to the cabinet where we keep our room temperature foods stored. Choosing the kind of cereal I wanted that day was easy. I hated Wheaties and the only other cereal that appealed to me there was Cheerios. I pick up the box and get a bowl from the a cabinet to the left of the sink. After pouring out the cereal and getting the milk I realized that I had a History test that day, great. I unhappily pour the milk into my bowl and  put the milk back in the fridge.  I got a spoon from the drawer under the microwave counter and sat down at the dinner table.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWhy is it called a \u2018dinner table\u2019 if we eat a variety of meals here throughout the day and not just dinner?\u201d I thought  to myself as I dreadfully started to shovel my breakfast down. I pick up my phone that I set down on  the table and turn it on. 7:20.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I then set an alarm for 7:50 on my phone and open Netflix to watch something while I ate. I have a bad habit of watching seven shows at once so I spent a few minutes trying to decide on what to watch. After some thought I clicked on \u201cThe Flash\u201d and finished the rest of the episode I was watching the night before. I had just enough time to finish the episode when my alarm went off. I got up and rinsed out my cereal bowl and put it in the dishwasher. While doing this I remembered the time I put Dawn dish soap in the dishwasher since we ran out of actual dishwasher soap. It overfload and there was soap all over the kitchen, coming out from all sides of the machine. I laugh to myself and walk down the hall and back to my room.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I gather my school things and put them into my bag along with my perfume that smells like roses for Desi. Next I put on my socks and shoes then find a hoodie to wear. I have a thing about hoodies. I wear one almost every single day of the school year. They keep me warm and are just comforting in an emotional way. I pick one that\u2019s black with white lettering that reads \u201cJust Do You\u201d . It\u2019s already cold outside, I can feel it in the house. I look at the time again and it reads 7:55. I walk down the hallway and into the bathroom to brush my teeth. At first when I spit out the toothpaste I panicked, I quickly realized the scent and sight of blood was from me brushing my gums too roughly. I hate the smell of blood, it smells like rusting iron and mold. It makes me nauseous. I set down my tooth brush and wrap one arm around my stomach and use my other hand to cling to the edge of the sink.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cJust breathe and count to ten.\u201d I tell myself and after a few minutes I collect myself and feel better. I then pick up my phone and look at the time. \u201c8:05. Shit.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I quickly throw my toothbrush back into the cabinet above the sink and walk out of the bathroom with my phone. I throw on my backpack on and walk to the end of the hall, to the door. I unlock it with a \u201cclink\u201d and open the door. The cold breeze of November breathes into my warm house. The smell of frost and snow make their way into my home. I close my eyes and breathe it in for a second. In that second everything else that was on my mind goes away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s the thing about nature with me. Whenever I look out of a window or smell the fresh air, my mind goes blank. It&amp;#39;s the only time I&amp;#39;m not worrying about anyone or anything. It&amp;#39;s enlightening in a way. A cat&amp;#39;s paws hit the ground and makes a soft \u201cthud\u201d as it hits the snow. Cats love to sit on the wall outside of my house this time of year. I sigh and step outside, closing the door behind me. I look to the left and my moms car is in the driveway still.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cShe&amp;#39;s going to be late again if she doesn&amp;#39;t get up soon.\u201d I think to myself as the cat from before walks up to me. It\u2019s green eyes stare back at me as it rubs its jet black fur against my leg. I get my gloves from my backpack and put them on before I pet the cat. It purrs as I rub behind its ears for a while.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cHannah!\u201d I hear an all too familiar voice call out from a distance. Desi. I look up and she\u2019s waving me over from her house. Her hair is wet again and I recall all the times me and her would run into her house in the winter so our hair wouldn&amp;#39;t freeze in the cold. I smile to myself on the thought and start to walk over to her. The cat follows me as I cross the road.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cHi, you might want to get into your house before your hair freezes again.\u201d I laugh and walk back with her to her house. Desi is the type of girl who\u2019s friends with a lot of people. Some of the people I don&amp;#39;t particularly like, but she&amp;#39;s a good person. I swear she eats drama for breakfast sometimes though.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI have it in a bun, but you\u2019re right. It is kinda cold out and we both know I don&amp;#39;t know what a coat is in the weather so let&amp;#39;s go inside. The bus should be here in like 5 minutes.\u201d She replied and opened the door.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cDang Desi, do you not use a heater? It\u2019s colder in here then it is outside!\u201d I complain as I step into her house and prepare to be attacked by her dogs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cThe dogs are in with my mom. We do use a heater but believe it or not it&amp;#39;s actually warmer in here by one degree.\u201d Desi teases and sits down on her steps.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She tells me about some more drama between her and this girl I\u2019ve never met before. I told you she eats it for breakfast. The bus turns the corner then and we see it in her door window.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cOh thank goodness, the bus is here.\u201d I breathe and Desi laughs. She knows I don\u2019t care about the latest scandal in school.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We walk out of her house and into the cold again. She was right, her house is warmer then it is out here. We walk a few steps to the stop sign which is the bus stop and get onto the bus once it stops.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The smell of leather hits me as I step onto the bus and take my seat. Desi walks to the back where all of her friends who I don\u2019t like very much sit. We are the first ones on the bus in the morning so its quiet. I look out the window and lose track of time. My friend, Lea sits down next to me then.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cAre you okay dude, you look kinda depressed?\u201d She asks and sets her bag in her lap. Lea\u2019s the kind of person I can live with if I wanted to. We have a lot in common and like the same people. We mostly talk about some reality youtubers like Shane Dawson who is our favorite. Sometimes we talk about how we used to like anime and cringe at the fact that we went through that faze.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cYeah im okay.\u201d I reply, \u201cI just zoned out again I guess. How was your night?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cIt was okay. I fell asleep at 7 again and didn&amp;#39;t wake up until my alarm went off at 7:30. So I got a full 12 and a half hours of sleep. We both know I needed it though, I dont usually sleep much.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cYeah,\u201d I laugh. \u201cYou sure did get a lot more sleep then I did though. I didn&amp;#39;t fall asleep until close to 4 this morning. I haven\u2019t been sleeping well again.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cDo you think it\u2019s because of your gut feelings you&amp;#39;ve been getting recently?\u201d Lea asks as we turn the corner to the school.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI don\u2019t know, maybe.\u201d I say and think about the feelings I\u2019ve been getting again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My mother, sister, father, grandma, and some more of my relatives all have seen some dead relatives. They don\u2019t look scary, but they see them in places like the coseno or their old house walking to the bathroom. I personally haven\u2019t seen anything like this before but I do get these feelings and visions in a way, like my dad. In the back of my mind throughout the day I see visions but I don&amp;#39;t notice them until they happen. It\u2019s like the case of deja vu\u2019 but I\u2019ve seen the event happen before in my head. I don\u2019t understand why and it confuses me, but my dad gets the same thing sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also get these gut feelings when it comes to my sister or other important people in my life. I get the feeling in the pit of my stomach and my chest that something may happen soon. Whenever I get this feeling something does happen that day, three days later, or even a week later. I mostly get this feeling and then something happens with my sister. Sometimes though, something happens to my other family members like my grandma for instance. Once I got this gut feeling about my grandma and two days later she tripped and hurt her ankle while walking down the stairs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We pull into the school parking lot then and into the bus lane.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cTime for prison.\u201d I joked and got off the bus which was now loud with verious chatter.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Walking into school I hear the bell ring and the sound of people opening and shutting their lockers. I walk up the stairs located in the main lobby and to mine. Both people who are next to me just left to walk to homeroom so I have more space. The lockers at my school are small. Some are the size of an old square box t.v but mine is probably the size of a tall and thin cd rack. I get out my locker key from my backpack and unlock my locker. I cannot work a combination lock to save my life. I open my locker and stuff my bag into it as best as I could. I then open the cubby at the top of it by flicking a little metal bar inside of the main part of the locker. I grab my notebooks for science, history, and english, along with my pencil bag and book. I was reading \u201cThe Tale of Despereaux\u201d for the hundredth time. Something about the book just speaks to me, maybe it\u2019s the happy ending.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I close my both parts of my locker and start to walk to homeroom. I work my way down the hall, down the stairs, and to the right where Mrs.Gill greats me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cGood morning!\u201d She smiles and I smile in agnolishment. Mrs.Gill is nice and can make homeroom and first period fun sometimes. Homeroom and first period went was dragged on like always. All I usually do is sit there and read. After an hour and a half a book can get a bit boring if you don&amp;#39;t take breaks. Mrs.Gill didn\u2019t have anything fun to show us that day so nothing important happened. I pretty much finished my book before the bell rang for second period.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That\u2019s when it started to happen. As I walked down the halls, I started to notice how pretty everyone is, even on a day like Monday.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWow, I\u2019m really not all that good looking.\u201d I thought to myself for what seemed like the tenth time in my life. Everyone has days where they don\u2019t feel good about themselves, but this day was the first day I took it in deep.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That\u2019s all I thought about for the rest of the day. Second period went by like a blur, Ms.Hobz just had us do book work for our upcoming science test that Friday. I didn\u2019t eat lunch that day, I just took it out of my bag and threw it away. Food disgusted me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you eating anything, Hannah?\u201d My friend Abbi asked me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cNot hungry.\u201d I said and just lied my head down. I was.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Abbi was one of my closest friends at the time. We could write a paragraph about what one of us were thinking about just by looking at each others faces. She was always there for me, but she also has self-confidence issues so I didn&amp;#39;t bring up mine with her. I knew better than to talk about my issues with her. She always found a way to make them about herself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fourth period rolled around and that\u2019s when I\u2019d almost always fall asleep. I can\u2019t help that no one talks so it\u2019s always quiet in my History class. My teacher, Mrs.John hated it, but it was nice to have a relaxing class. I like history, it\u2019s an easier subject to learn unlike science and math. I got called on twice to answer questions, I hate being called on. The spotlight is not for me. I luckily knew the answers to both questions. I usually do, I just don\u2019t want to answer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fifth period had my favorite teacher, Mr.Scall. He was my english teacher and always nagged me about not writing enough. He still does to this day. I can be walking down the hall to third period and he\u2019ll stop me and say,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cHannah! You don\u2019t write enough.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019d say something along the lines of \u201cYes, I know Mr.Scall.\u201d and walk to third.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That day we were presenting our monologues to the class. Me and my friend Natasha decided to to act out a skit about &lt;em&gt;Shark Tank&lt;/em&gt;. Our prop was a zombie toy and I was one of the sharks. Natasha was presenting her item (the toy) to me and in the end, after we made the deal she said it was a fake. The class loved our act, but I still hate presenting things to this day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sixth period came and I walked to math class with Ms.Po. Sixth period was the only class I absolutely hated. The people there were always so wound up and always gave Ms.Po a hard time. There were only six people  in the class out of 15 that she actually could rely on to complete the work. Me of course, being one of them. People always say I throw myself into my work, it\u2019s true. It keeps me from thinking bad about myself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, sixth period went by fast and the bell rang. I walked to my locker and looked at the ground for the most part. I didn\u2019t want to see anyone\u2019s pretty faces again. I unlock my locker and open the cubby at the top again to put my books in it. I then grab my backpack and check my phone. Five miss calls from mom.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cGreat.\u201d I say to myself as the people beside me open their lockers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I put my phone in my hoodie pocket and put on my backpack straps. I next shut my locker and walked down the hall to my friend Alanna\u2019s locker.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Alanna is my second best friend. I honestly like her more than Abbi for some pretty obvious reasons. She\u2019s more humble and Abbi always tried so hard to make everything about her. Alanna on the other hand, doesn\u2019t talk about herself enough. I worry about her. She always had her blonde hair up in a bun or a ponytail. She mostly wears hoodies, like me and sweatpants. We both prefer to be comfortable over stylish.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cHey.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cHey.\u201d She replies and shuts her locker. We walk down the hall and down the stairs to exit the school building.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cHow was your day?\u201d I asked as we walked over to the tree in the front of the building to wait for our rides to get there. The grounds in front of the building look so much bigger when there are people on almost every inch of it. Great, more pretty faces to look at.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cIt was good. Ms.Hob\u2019s class was fun.\u201d Alanna replies. She starts to talk about what they did but I wasn\u2019t paying attention. That\u2019s when I saw him. He was standing just a few feet in front of me talking to some of the people who ride my bus. I didn\u2019t recognize him until now but, he rides my bus too. For a second it seemed like time had frozen. Everything around me that was still, it\u2019s like the Earth shifted and everything that needed to be balanced, was.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cHannah?\u201d A distant voice calls and it snaps me back to reality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cHannah! Your bus is here! Hello?\u201d Alanna shouts and I blink at her blakely. I look at her and back at him getting on the bus and I swear I could see him smiling and shaking his head at me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWhat is this witchcraft?\u201d I laugh to myself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cUm, what?\u201d Alanna asks confused. \u201cNevermind, just get on the bus before it leaves you behind.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I turned and started walking to my bus, in what seemed like autopilot.  I couldn\u2019t think straight as I sat down next to Lea on the bus.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cDude, what happened? You look actually shooketh.\u201d  Lea asks, concerned.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cNothing.\u201d I assure all to quickly, even for me. \u201c I um\u2026 I\u2019ll text you later about it,\u201d I say trying to recover from my quick reply.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cOkay?\u201d Lea says and puts in her ear buds to listen to music.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I did the same and halfway through the bus ride home, I open my eyes that where apparently closed. A reaction to his voice I heard yelling out of one of the bus windows.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cYou\u2019re smoking cancer sticks!\u201d He calls out to people who are walking down the sidewalks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I smile and shake my head. \u201cWhat is his name?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cJacob!\u201d Mr.Jo calls, \u201cSit down and cut that out before you cause me to crash this bus.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cJacob.\u201d I think to myself, smiling as I shake my head.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cOh, you wouldn\u2019t do that Mr.Jo!\u201d Jacob replies smiling, as he shuts the window and heads back to his seat.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can\u2019t help but listen to the conversations on the bus the rest of the ride home. Almost everyone had gotten off the bus by the time I put my earbuds away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cBye Lea.\u201d I say as I move out of her way so she can get off of the bus.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cBye, my dude.\u201d She calls back and starts to walk home.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Everyone who sits in the back of the bus then moves up to the front for the last two stops. The bus driver turns the corner to mine and Desi\u2019s bus stop and we stand up to get off.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cBye Desi, bye Hannah.\u201d Jacob says as we walk off the bus.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cBye.\u201d Desi laughs and starts to walk home.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I couldn\u2019t say anything back. I was afraid I\u2019d choke if I tried.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cHow does he know my name?\u201d I  whisper to myself as I walk home on the sidewalk. I look up to see my dogs in the window wagging their tails. They start to bark as I open the mailbox to get the mail.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks aging for reading this. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "36bc2024-016e-11e4-94a6-12313b01ac51", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qi02", "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "9sycm0", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Skye_Clover", "num_crossposts": 0, "num_comments": 0, "send_replies": true, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/stories/comments/9sycm0/scratches_scissors_mirror_food_disappointment/", "whitelist_status": null, "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/9sycm0/scratches_scissors_mirror_food_disappointment/", "subreddit_subscribers": 7162, "created_utc": 1540989699.0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "stories", "selftext": " Welcome back everyone, you\u2019re listening to the irregularly broadcasted Remake America radio show. We\u2019ll continue with events that happened about a year after what happened in my first semester of kindergarten. For those who are new here, we won\u2019t be able to catch you up because there is too much that you\u2019ve missed. The government hasn\u2019t done anything bad this far into our lives, but they have done bad to millions in this world. We\u2019ll see how far our encryption will allow us to take y\u2019all since the last time we spoke.\n\n We\u2019re going to start on two weeks before Christmas when we were talking about how Santa delivered all the presents in one night. Like every other group of kids, there was one of us who didn\u2019t believe that he was alone when he delivered the presents. The person in our group that didn\u2019t believe that Santa could work alone was John. Once our parents heard us talking about it, they told us that Santa had some trained elves that would enter certain houses while he directed his cloaked ship. When we heard this, Josh caught on with the lie asking, \u201cDoesn\u2019t Santa drive a sleigh with twelve popular reindeer?\u201d\n\n Mr. Morris then thought quick and told us that it was the cloaking device on the space ship disguising itself as a sleigh. While some of us were convinced, some of us didn\u2019t believe that Santa had technology that was years ahead of what was out in the market, or thought to be out in the military. After a few minutes of our parents trying to convince us that they weren\u2019t lying, we finally gave up, and let our parents believe that they convinced us. Right when our parents left, we started to talk about the correlation of elves and midgets.\n\nWhen we were done with Santa and everything surrounding Christmas lore, we started to think if our parents received or bought the presents before Christmas and put them under the Christmas tree Christmas night. We planned to check our basements one night and our attics the next until Christmas Night to make sure that our parents didn\u2019t have any presents.  We didn\u2019t actually start looking until the two nights before Christmas. The first night we didn\u2019t see anything because we looked in the wrong spot. On the cusp of the afternoon and dusk of Christmas Eve while our parents were finishing food for our Christmas dinner, we saw the presents in our individual attics.\n\nWe eventually went outside to play a little before dinner so that we could eat enough food tonight. The only ones that didn\u2019t look for the presents were the Bennett Sisters. When our parents told us that it was time for dinner, we let the Bennett sisters go so that we could start talking about the presents. We started to group up and as soon as we were close enough for nobody to hear us John started to flip out. Right when he started to flip out, we had to calm him down so none of our parents would notice. Consequently the nosy kid in the block was out and saw us have to calm John down, came and wanted to know what was happening. When he began speaking, we all shouted over him screaming, \u201cShut up Kyle!!!!\u201d\n\nRight after that, he ran off and we started to talk about what we saw. Josh was the first one who started to shout in a whispered form. Maddie start to cry right when Josh ended talking, with David hugging her for comfort. While she was crying, we continued talking about the presents and our parents betrayal against our trust. After a few minutes of us talking, My mom came out and told us that we had to come in because the food was going to get cold, and our the prayer was going to start in a bit. When she was done, I told everyone, \u201cWe\u2019ll discuss this tomorrow afternoon after playing with our new toys.\u201d \n\nWe huddled up and I picked Shaw to pick our huddle break.  He screamed out, \u201cUNBREAKABLE ON THREE\u2026 ONE, TWO, THREE\u2026\u201d We all then screamed unbreakable in unison like a sports team right before and after the game. Right after, we ate dinner and had fun for a little while. This year we started a new tradition were on midnight we sung Jesus happy birthday. Right after singing, we had our annual Secret Santa, and it lasted for about an hour or so. When finished with Secret Santa we all cleaned up and went home for an early Christmas morning.\n\nThe morning after we found woke up and went down to see what presents we had that Christmas. Each one of us gravitated towards our largest presents first, but our parents told us to save them for last. When all of the smaller toys were opened the big one and when opened, we saw that we each had telescopes. We all noticed that we received the presents that we wanted and very little candy. A few moments later we went outside to play with each other for the rest of the day.\n\nRight when the Bennett sisters were too tired hang out with us, they went home, while we stayed outside.\n\nAs soon as we noticed their door close we stopped playing our game of tag. We instantly started to talk about what went on talking about how we were going to keep our own secrets. Jarrod then said, \u201cHave any of y\u2019all ever heard of the story of secret societies?\u201d He was the only one of the group to hear about it at this point from one of the other students in school. We all told him to tell us what they were in the old campfire, ghost story manner. What he told us was that there are several secretive groups that control the different workforce sectors and influenced our every move. I was the first one that was convinced of creating a secret society of our own. While he finished his story, I tried to focus on a way on how to convince everyone else outside to create our own form of a secret society.\n\nEventually he finished and I started to plant the seeds of secrecy. While everyone were trying to think of a way to rebel their own way, my plan was kicking in. Everyone wanted to push my idea away, even though they knew that it was our best option. The first person to join the cause was David, and then one by one. The most reluctant person to join the cause was Katherine, it took us about seven minutes of convincing from everyone to get her to join. After Katie joined us, Derrick said that we had to go home and get play with our toys.\n\nAs soon as midnight came, we all arrived right outside her window. She had a place where she had found a while she was bored one day during the fall that she thought looked cool. Before we started to move, I asked everyone, \u201cDoes everyone have what we need???\u201d Everyone said that they had everything that we needed. Jacob told everyone to stay partnered up, and to stay within inches of the others. We started following Hailey to the spot had in mind for us for about five minutes to get there. John started to complain three minutes into the walking to our destination.\n\nWhen we arrived to a little spot that had some rocks big enough for fifteen teenagers to sit around, Hailey said, \u201cIs this good enough for you John???\u201d He stopped complaining and responded with, \u201cFor sure this is good enough for me!!!\u201d I followed up by telling everyone to get enough wood and rocks to make a big enough fire to heat us up. It took us about seven minutes to get enough twigs and rocks to make a fire. Before sitting down Josh, Tyler, and I had a few rules that we had to tell everyone else. The first rule was to pick a partner and to stick by their side at all times. The second rule was that they could never tell anyone about what we did at any cost. And the final rule was to do never break our vows we were going to take that night.\n\nWe all raised our hands and Jarrod began telling us to repeat the vows after him. The vows were all but meaningless to any of us when we started this. \u201cI vow to never betray the people I call family as long as I belong to this society. None of the decisions that I make will ever compromise the livelihood of our existence. We only bring light to the world we belong to, for I represent honor, respect, love. We protect the innocent from the hands of danger for the existence of the group. We have become The Fort.\u201d\n\nAfter the vows, we then decided that the first meeting of every week should always be scary stories night. We only told about five stories due to scaring each other with the fact that we were in the woods in between every story. When finished and poured the fire out before leaving our new sight. By the time we were back in the neighborhood, we have realized that it was one in the morning. We all went to each of our houses and helped ourselves get into our rooms before we went back to sleep. Hailey was the last to go back to her house because she was the only one to have a bedroom in the first floor.\n\nAfter a few meetings, we started to get a hold of things were becoming for us. We eventually came to an understanding that there would be no leader, and everyone would have an equal voice. Our Treasurer was John, since he could manage his allowances a little bit better than everyone else. The Secretary we chose was Katie since she liked keeping attendance like a teacher would. Madeline was in charge of the checking the things we brought every night. The last position we gave someone was Timekeeper, and was given to Jarrod since he was extremely punctual and had a watch on him at all times. We all agreed that we would always meet in our spot at midnight, and leave either at one on the dot or one-thirty every night. Since our parents always made us go to church on Sunday, we would never meet in between Saturday and Sunday to stay awake in church.\n\nOn our first week\u2019s anniversary we tried to celebrate somehow. Early that day we tried to plan everything out since it was New Year\u2019s Eve. David had the great idea of having our meeting right after our parents tuck us in, and taking some of the sodas and juices over to the \u201cFortsight.\u201d We all agreed to what David said, and snuck out after being tucked into our beds. After being at the sight, singing our favorite songs and telling mildly scary ghost stories, we went back home. When arriving to my home and back into bed, we noticed that it was around two twenty-three in the morning.\n\nThe next night when we met, we concentrated the meeting on returning to school that following Monday. We all talked about how we wanted to do some interesting game, read an great book, or new exercise that could strengthen us better. We then remembered that we would most likely have to stop our meetings for school. Shaw then remembered that we all received walkie-talkies, binoculars, and telescopes. Derrick then said, \u201cWe could change the time we meet, and use our walkie-talkies and binoculars to talk to each other from our rooms.\u201d When finished, we all agreed to have our meetings by walkie-talkies and binoculars until each semester ended or until we were old enough to sneak out as teens usually did.\n\nThe first night we started the last semester of the school year, we started our meeting at our individual rooms. Our queue to start the meeting was when we heard two clicks on our walkie-talkies. When ten thirty came, I clicked my walkie-talkie twice so that everybody would know that it was time. The first person to talk was John, asking us what we should do tomorrow during recess since it was a new semester. We each started to talk about how we should start doing more things together. I then said, \u201cWe should actually getting our own circles so that we could get more used to what the real world is going to be like.\u201d Everyone was reluctant to admit that I was right for about a minute. After a minute of silence, everybody started to agree. I told them that we would still meet at our secret society at nights.\n\nWhen that following night came, Katie was the one to click her walkie-talkie at the same time as I did the night before. We talked about our search was going for new circles was coming along. The one who was having the most problem was Maddie, since she was the most introverted of the group. We eventually started help her get a new group of friends to make it easier for her to become a little more extroverted. After getting her a group where she could be by herself and not be by Katie\u2019s side all day long. When she described us her new group of friends, she told us the exact description of a group of hippies. Half way into the explanation, we all started to laugh because we all thought that hippies were the funniest type of people.\n\nWith our new friends, we decided that we would have each other\u2019s backs before anyone outside of the group. On our third night while talking about our outside groups, we decided that we would watch each one of the groups we were a part of, to make sure there weren\u2019t any \u201cthreats.\u201d Our only question was for how long we should scout all of the groups and how stealthily. Jarrod said that more than a week of coming up daily and asking questions, and each group would start getting suspicious. I thought that one pair of Fort partners should search a group every three days so that we would look less suspicious, and then another pair of partners until we scout like the former pair. The only difference each pair would change is their patterns of going to each group from the previous pairs.\n\nAfter all of us went through with checking each other\u2019s groups, our suspicions grew towards most of the people in them. We decided that the night the we were done observing each group, we would tell our findings to each other. Tonight, Josh introduced the clicking ceremony to start the meeting. We went group by group deciding if the person should stay in that group or leave the group. The first group we picked for discussion was John\u2019s since he was the toughest to decide if he should stay or leave. We decided to end on Mary\u2019s group since we gave her the \u201cperfect\u201d group and she already told us about how they acted.\n\nWhen coming to our conclusion, we chose to vote on what we should do with each of our groups. Our votes on what decision to pick took several tries due to us not being able to choose a single way of how to manage each of the groups. After about four or five times, Derrick decided that it would be a better idea for us to have each other\u2019s backs just in case one of us had a fight with someone in outside of our group. With Derrick\u2019s comment in the air, we decided to choose his idea, and have each other\u2019s backs even when we had our other groups backing us in a fight. With our conclusion finished, we ended our meeting for the night and went to sleep right after.\n\nOn the first Monday of March, we had our weekly Scarefest Night. For the first night of the semester, we went back to the Fortsight. After a few months of scary stories, we\u2019ve became used to scary stories. Our first story started at the fear factor of sixth graders while we were four and five year old\u2019s. Jarrod began his version of the story of The Hook where the boyfriend is hung on top of a 1966 Chevelle SS while his girlfriend waited in the car for him to reenter the car. David followed up with the story of the Krampus on Christmas night while everyone slept peacefully. When most of us ended, Madeline was the last to start her story, which was Bloody Mary, where Mary could leave teleport through the mirror and kill teens that had premarital sex. When we ended, we mentioned how we should talk about doing new things for the group following night.\n\nWhen we were in recess the following day, we decided that we should play tag football until the end of the school day. The team captains were Josh and I, with Josh being first pick and me getting the ball first. While we played, the teachers watched so that nothing would happen like the year before where Josh raged out of control. Mr. Freeman was looking out for the Kindergarteners since they were even more fragile than us first graders. We played for the most of the hour besides half time and when it was time for us to go. As soon as it was time for us to go back inside, Josh\u2019s team threw a Hail Mary, which I intercepted a pass which Josh threw. Unlike John, Josh had more control of his emotions when it came to fair plays.\n\nWhen day came to night, we waited for midnight to come for us to go to the Fortsight. With seven minutes to go, we all met in front of the window of Hailey\u2019s room. We had to wait for her since she hadn\u2019t come out yet, and she typically took us to the Sight. Our impatience beat us, from waiting for her, so most of us went without her since we\u2019ve become used to our route. The person who stayed was her partner, or Josh. Hailey came out three minutes late, so they had to run so that they wouldn\u2019t be late for the opening ceremony. By the time they arrived, we were raising our hands to start the ceremony. If they would have missed just a fraction what we were going to say, they would have to do some type of exercise until we finished.\n\nWhen the OC (Opening Ceremony) ended, we sat down and started to discuss what new activities we should have for following meetings. Josh decided that we should start dedicating each meeting to a certain things that would benefit us. We decided to vote as usual, and one by one we each gave our votes on the idea. After each one of us went by, we had a unanimous agreement on progressive meetings. We each said things we knew we needed, like physical and mental progression, knowledge, hiding skills, and more. Each meeting had were designated to specific occurrences like every other meeting. While this was occurring, Oakley was watching us in secret wondering what was happening.", "author_fullname": "t2_3yr3d9f", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Hiding Spot", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/stories", "hidden": false, "pwls": null, "link_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "parent_whitelist_status": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_9sv53t", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2, "domain": "self.stories", "media_embed": {}, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": null, "can_mod_post": false, "score": 2, "approved_by": null, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1540984938.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "contest_mode": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Welcome back everyone, you\u2019re listening to the irregularly broadcasted Remake America radio show. We\u2019ll continue with events that happened about a year after what happened in my first semester of kindergarten. For those who are new here, we won\u2019t be able to catch you up because there is too much that you\u2019ve missed. The government hasn\u2019t done anything bad this far into our lives, but they have done bad to millions in this world. We\u2019ll see how far our encryption will allow us to take y\u2019all since the last time we spoke.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We\u2019re going to start on two weeks before Christmas when we were talking about how Santa delivered all the presents in one night. Like every other group of kids, there was one of us who didn\u2019t believe that he was alone when he delivered the presents. The person in our group that didn\u2019t believe that Santa could work alone was John. Once our parents heard us talking about it, they told us that Santa had some trained elves that would enter certain houses while he directed his cloaked ship. When we heard this, Josh caught on with the lie asking, \u201cDoesn\u2019t Santa drive a sleigh with twelve popular reindeer?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mr. Morris then thought quick and told us that it was the cloaking device on the space ship disguising itself as a sleigh. While some of us were convinced, some of us didn\u2019t believe that Santa had technology that was years ahead of what was out in the market, or thought to be out in the military. After a few minutes of our parents trying to convince us that they weren\u2019t lying, we finally gave up, and let our parents believe that they convinced us. Right when our parents left, we started to talk about the correlation of elves and midgets.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When we were done with Santa and everything surrounding Christmas lore, we started to think if our parents received or bought the presents before Christmas and put them under the Christmas tree Christmas night. We planned to check our basements one night and our attics the next until Christmas Night to make sure that our parents didn\u2019t have any presents.  We didn\u2019t actually start looking until the two nights before Christmas. The first night we didn\u2019t see anything because we looked in the wrong spot. On the cusp of the afternoon and dusk of Christmas Eve while our parents were finishing food for our Christmas dinner, we saw the presents in our individual attics.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We eventually went outside to play a little before dinner so that we could eat enough food tonight. The only ones that didn\u2019t look for the presents were the Bennett Sisters. When our parents told us that it was time for dinner, we let the Bennett sisters go so that we could start talking about the presents. We started to group up and as soon as we were close enough for nobody to hear us John started to flip out. Right when he started to flip out, we had to calm him down so none of our parents would notice. Consequently the nosy kid in the block was out and saw us have to calm John down, came and wanted to know what was happening. When he began speaking, we all shouted over him screaming, \u201cShut up Kyle!!!!\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Right after that, he ran off and we started to talk about what we saw. Josh was the first one who started to shout in a whispered form. Maddie start to cry right when Josh ended talking, with David hugging her for comfort. While she was crying, we continued talking about the presents and our parents betrayal against our trust. After a few minutes of us talking, My mom came out and told us that we had to come in because the food was going to get cold, and our the prayer was going to start in a bit. When she was done, I told everyone, \u201cWe\u2019ll discuss this tomorrow afternoon after playing with our new toys.\u201d &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We huddled up and I picked Shaw to pick our huddle break.  He screamed out, \u201cUNBREAKABLE ON THREE\u2026 ONE, TWO, THREE\u2026\u201d We all then screamed unbreakable in unison like a sports team right before and after the game. Right after, we ate dinner and had fun for a little while. This year we started a new tradition were on midnight we sung Jesus happy birthday. Right after singing, we had our annual Secret Santa, and it lasted for about an hour or so. When finished with Secret Santa we all cleaned up and went home for an early Christmas morning.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The morning after we found woke up and went down to see what presents we had that Christmas. Each one of us gravitated towards our largest presents first, but our parents told us to save them for last. When all of the smaller toys were opened the big one and when opened, we saw that we each had telescopes. We all noticed that we received the presents that we wanted and very little candy. A few moments later we went outside to play with each other for the rest of the day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Right when the Bennett sisters were too tired hang out with us, they went home, while we stayed outside.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As soon as we noticed their door close we stopped playing our game of tag. We instantly started to talk about what went on talking about how we were going to keep our own secrets. Jarrod then said, \u201cHave any of y\u2019all ever heard of the story of secret societies?\u201d He was the only one of the group to hear about it at this point from one of the other students in school. We all told him to tell us what they were in the old campfire, ghost story manner. What he told us was that there are several secretive groups that control the different workforce sectors and influenced our every move. I was the first one that was convinced of creating a secret society of our own. While he finished his story, I tried to focus on a way on how to convince everyone else outside to create our own form of a secret society.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Eventually he finished and I started to plant the seeds of secrecy. While everyone were trying to think of a way to rebel their own way, my plan was kicking in. Everyone wanted to push my idea away, even though they knew that it was our best option. The first person to join the cause was David, and then one by one. The most reluctant person to join the cause was Katherine, it took us about seven minutes of convincing from everyone to get her to join. After Katie joined us, Derrick said that we had to go home and get play with our toys.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As soon as midnight came, we all arrived right outside her window. She had a place where she had found a while she was bored one day during the fall that she thought looked cool. Before we started to move, I asked everyone, \u201cDoes everyone have what we need???\u201d Everyone said that they had everything that we needed. Jacob told everyone to stay partnered up, and to stay within inches of the others. We started following Hailey to the spot had in mind for us for about five minutes to get there. John started to complain three minutes into the walking to our destination.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When we arrived to a little spot that had some rocks big enough for fifteen teenagers to sit around, Hailey said, \u201cIs this good enough for you John???\u201d He stopped complaining and responded with, \u201cFor sure this is good enough for me!!!\u201d I followed up by telling everyone to get enough wood and rocks to make a big enough fire to heat us up. It took us about seven minutes to get enough twigs and rocks to make a fire. Before sitting down Josh, Tyler, and I had a few rules that we had to tell everyone else. The first rule was to pick a partner and to stick by their side at all times. The second rule was that they could never tell anyone about what we did at any cost. And the final rule was to do never break our vows we were going to take that night.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We all raised our hands and Jarrod began telling us to repeat the vows after him. The vows were all but meaningless to any of us when we started this. \u201cI vow to never betray the people I call family as long as I belong to this society. None of the decisions that I make will ever compromise the livelihood of our existence. We only bring light to the world we belong to, for I represent honor, respect, love. We protect the innocent from the hands of danger for the existence of the group. We have become The Fort.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After the vows, we then decided that the first meeting of every week should always be scary stories night. We only told about five stories due to scaring each other with the fact that we were in the woods in between every story. When finished and poured the fire out before leaving our new sight. By the time we were back in the neighborhood, we have realized that it was one in the morning. We all went to each of our houses and helped ourselves get into our rooms before we went back to sleep. Hailey was the last to go back to her house because she was the only one to have a bedroom in the first floor.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After a few meetings, we started to get a hold of things were becoming for us. We eventually came to an understanding that there would be no leader, and everyone would have an equal voice. Our Treasurer was John, since he could manage his allowances a little bit better than everyone else. The Secretary we chose was Katie since she liked keeping attendance like a teacher would. Madeline was in charge of the checking the things we brought every night. The last position we gave someone was Timekeeper, and was given to Jarrod since he was extremely punctual and had a watch on him at all times. We all agreed that we would always meet in our spot at midnight, and leave either at one on the dot or one-thirty every night. Since our parents always made us go to church on Sunday, we would never meet in between Saturday and Sunday to stay awake in church.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On our first week\u2019s anniversary we tried to celebrate somehow. Early that day we tried to plan everything out since it was New Year\u2019s Eve. David had the great idea of having our meeting right after our parents tuck us in, and taking some of the sodas and juices over to the \u201cFortsight.\u201d We all agreed to what David said, and snuck out after being tucked into our beds. After being at the sight, singing our favorite songs and telling mildly scary ghost stories, we went back home. When arriving to my home and back into bed, we noticed that it was around two twenty-three in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The next night when we met, we concentrated the meeting on returning to school that following Monday. We all talked about how we wanted to do some interesting game, read an great book, or new exercise that could strengthen us better. We then remembered that we would most likely have to stop our meetings for school. Shaw then remembered that we all received walkie-talkies, binoculars, and telescopes. Derrick then said, \u201cWe could change the time we meet, and use our walkie-talkies and binoculars to talk to each other from our rooms.\u201d When finished, we all agreed to have our meetings by walkie-talkies and binoculars until each semester ended or until we were old enough to sneak out as teens usually did.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The first night we started the last semester of the school year, we started our meeting at our individual rooms. Our queue to start the meeting was when we heard two clicks on our walkie-talkies. When ten thirty came, I clicked my walkie-talkie twice so that everybody would know that it was time. The first person to talk was John, asking us what we should do tomorrow during recess since it was a new semester. We each started to talk about how we should start doing more things together. I then said, \u201cWe should actually getting our own circles so that we could get more used to what the real world is going to be like.\u201d Everyone was reluctant to admit that I was right for about a minute. After a minute of silence, everybody started to agree. I told them that we would still meet at our secret society at nights.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When that following night came, Katie was the one to click her walkie-talkie at the same time as I did the night before. We talked about our search was going for new circles was coming along. The one who was having the most problem was Maddie, since she was the most introverted of the group. We eventually started help her get a new group of friends to make it easier for her to become a little more extroverted. After getting her a group where she could be by herself and not be by Katie\u2019s side all day long. When she described us her new group of friends, she told us the exact description of a group of hippies. Half way into the explanation, we all started to laugh because we all thought that hippies were the funniest type of people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With our new friends, we decided that we would have each other\u2019s backs before anyone outside of the group. On our third night while talking about our outside groups, we decided that we would watch each one of the groups we were a part of, to make sure there weren\u2019t any \u201cthreats.\u201d Our only question was for how long we should scout all of the groups and how stealthily. Jarrod said that more than a week of coming up daily and asking questions, and each group would start getting suspicious. I thought that one pair of Fort partners should search a group every three days so that we would look less suspicious, and then another pair of partners until we scout like the former pair. The only difference each pair would change is their patterns of going to each group from the previous pairs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After all of us went through with checking each other\u2019s groups, our suspicions grew towards most of the people in them. We decided that the night the we were done observing each group, we would tell our findings to each other. Tonight, Josh introduced the clicking ceremony to start the meeting. We went group by group deciding if the person should stay in that group or leave the group. The first group we picked for discussion was John\u2019s since he was the toughest to decide if he should stay or leave. We decided to end on Mary\u2019s group since we gave her the \u201cperfect\u201d group and she already told us about how they acted.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When coming to our conclusion, we chose to vote on what we should do with each of our groups. Our votes on what decision to pick took several tries due to us not being able to choose a single way of how to manage each of the groups. After about four or five times, Derrick decided that it would be a better idea for us to have each other\u2019s backs just in case one of us had a fight with someone in outside of our group. With Derrick\u2019s comment in the air, we decided to choose his idea, and have each other\u2019s backs even when we had our other groups backing us in a fight. With our conclusion finished, we ended our meeting for the night and went to sleep right after.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On the first Monday of March, we had our weekly Scarefest Night. For the first night of the semester, we went back to the Fortsight. After a few months of scary stories, we\u2019ve became used to scary stories. Our first story started at the fear factor of sixth graders while we were four and five year old\u2019s. Jarrod began his version of the story of The Hook where the boyfriend is hung on top of a 1966 Chevelle SS while his girlfriend waited in the car for him to reenter the car. David followed up with the story of the Krampus on Christmas night while everyone slept peacefully. When most of us ended, Madeline was the last to start her story, which was Bloody Mary, where Mary could leave teleport through the mirror and kill teens that had premarital sex. When we ended, we mentioned how we should talk about doing new things for the group following night.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When we were in recess the following day, we decided that we should play tag football until the end of the school day. The team captains were Josh and I, with Josh being first pick and me getting the ball first. While we played, the teachers watched so that nothing would happen like the year before where Josh raged out of control. Mr. Freeman was looking out for the Kindergarteners since they were even more fragile than us first graders. We played for the most of the hour besides half time and when it was time for us to go. As soon as it was time for us to go back inside, Josh\u2019s team threw a Hail Mary, which I intercepted a pass which Josh threw.

I  figured going to this party was going to be good for me. I had every  intention to meet people and have a good time. I didn\u2019t have a costume,  but I slapped on some black and white face paint and made myself a very  shoddy-looking skull face. I thought it was cool at the time. Looking  back at my selfie, however, I can see how terrible it looked.\n\nAnyway, I showed up at this party and the friend who invited me was  nowhere to be found. I called him on the phone and he said he had to run  out real quick, but he would be back. OK cool. I waited for him.  Luckily, I knew one of the party hosts. She was a mutual friend of the  guy who invited me. Instead of a *\u201cWho are you, and why are you at my house\u201d* moment, I was warmly welcomed by an old acquaintance.\n\nIt was her apartment, and she had a couple of roommates. One of these  roommates was actually really attractive and made nice conversation  with me. Unfortunately both her boyfriend and her father were at the  party. I decided to move on.\n\nThe place was more packed with people than I realized. The party  stretched into the room next door, and even outside to a large rooftop  balcony. This meant I could excuse myself from the claustrophobic room  full of strangers and revitalize myself with some fresh air and a  cigarette. \u201c*Where the hell was my friend?\u201d* I kept wondering. I  checked up on him a couple times. I even reached out to a couple of  other friends to see if they wanted to stop by, but they were busy.\n\nEventually my friend did show up, but he kept leaving for some  reason. I was a little pissed off to say the least, but this was still a  cool party and I had nothing better to do. So I stayed for a while and  decided I would try to fit in and have a good time.\n\n#### \n\n#### This is where things get weird.\n\nI should have gone home. Instead I made small talk with a few people  and tried to fit in. I sipped on a couple beers and left my comfort zone  enough to talk to a few people. I tried talking to women, mostly. But  somehow I ended up being followed around by some older guy for the rest  of the night.\n\nHe seemed cool at first. We took a couple shots and talked about life  and family. His daughter was actually the hot roommate I talked about  earlier. He was a single middle-aged man trying to fit in with his  daughter\u2019s friends and people half his age. Clearly he must have felt  about as out of place as I did.\n\nWe took another shot. I was ready to call it quits and sober up for  the night. I still had to drive home later. But this guy wanted to rage  and handed me more shots. Now, totally drunk and needing to get away  from the peer pressure, I slipped out to the roof for another cigarette.  Maybe the cold air and nicotine would help me sober up a bit. By this  time I was totally messed up, though, and when some girl in the hallway  handed me a cookie I didn\u2019t hesitate to cram it in my mouth.\n\n#### \n\n#### I shouldn\u2019t have eaten the cookie.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn case you\u2019re not following, this wasn\u2019t a regular cookie. It was a  special cookie, and I had a low tolerance it. So this time when the guy  managed to make his way outside and find me, I started to lose it.\n\nI didn\u2019t get violent or angry. No, I got paranoid. I can\u2019t remember  what he was saying to me, but he started really freaking me out. It was  probably nothing to worry about. I think he was probably talking about  his divorce or something normal like that. But I was suddenly terrified  and I had to leave immediately. I called my friend again, but he wasn\u2019t  around. I told him I had to leave.\n\nI slipped away from the party as quickly and covertly as possible and  made my way back down the street to my car. There was no way in hell  that I should have been driving, but I was in a panic and I couldn\u2019t  stay there.\n\nI couldn\u2019t go home, either. I was in no state to face my mother. I  didn\u2019t want her to see how messed up I was or how I drove home heavily  under the influence. I didn\u2019t want the confrontation and I didn\u2019t want  to give her a heart attack either.\n\nSo I drove. When I got to my neighborhood I kept on driving. I ended  up stopping at a Walmart parking lot down the street from my  neighborhood. It was open 24 hours. It was late, but there were people  around and I didn\u2019t feel too suspicious.\n\nI didn\u2019t want to sit in the car, though. I vaguely remember going  inside and walking a lap around the store and calling one of my friends  on the phone for no reason other than to say I was freaking out.\n\nI went back to the car. I passed out. I threw up. I passed out again. I threw up again. The sun came up. I drove home.\n\n#### \n\n#### Not my finest moment.\n\nThe party was cool, but I didn\u2019t intend to spend the night yacking  and sleeping alone in my car in a Walmart parking lot. I had high hopes  for the evening, but I ended up feeling lower than low. I still feel  ashamed when I look back.  \n\n\nWhat was the lesson learned here? Clearly there were many mistakes  made. I shouldn\u2019t have given into the peer pressure and drunk so much. I  shouldn\u2019t have taken the cookie. I shouldn\u2019t have been smoking  cigarettes (although completely unrelated). Most of all, I shouldn\u2019t  have driven. I can\u2019t imagine the horror my life would be today if I had  crashed into someone that night.\n\nLuckily no one was harmed. Apparently my mom had been calling me all  night, worried sick, though. I must have been already passed out in the  car. I had to explain the next morning why I didn\u2019t come home or answer  her calls. I didn\u2019t give all the shameful details. I just told her I had  a little too much to drink and couldn\u2019t drive home. Also, I was sorry  and I must have been asleep when she called.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n#### Happy Halloween, folks. Be safe, and be kind.\n\n[https://100mistakes.blog/mistake-3-the-time-i-partied-too-hard-on-halloween/](https://100mistakes.blog/mistake-3-the-time-i-partied-too-hard-on-halloween/)", "author_fullname": "t2_28o40pe3", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "The Time I Partied Too Hard on Halloween", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/stories", "hidden": false, "pwls": null, "link_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "parent_whitelist_status": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_9slhl4", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3, "domain": "self.stories", "media_embed": {}, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": null, "can_mod_post": false, "score": 3, "approved_by": null, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1540910892.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "contest_mode": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;h4&gt;A few years back I was invited to a Halloween party.&lt;/h4&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was young, dumb, and single, not to mention awkward and depressed. I  figured going to this party was going to be good for me. I had every  intention to meet people and have a good time. I didn\u2019t have a costume,  but I slapped on some black and white face paint and made myself a very  shoddy-looking skull face. I thought it was cool at the time. Looking  back at my selfie, however, I can see how terrible it looked.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I showed up at this party and the friend who invited me was  nowhere to be found. I called him on the phone and he said he had to run  out real quick, but he would be back. OK cool. I waited for him.  Luckily, I knew one of the party hosts. She was a mutual friend of the  guy who invited me. Instead of a &lt;em&gt;\u201cWho are you, and why are you at my house\u201d&lt;/em&gt; moment, I was warmly welcomed by an old acquaintance.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was her apartment, and she had a couple of roommates. One of these  roommates was actually really attractive and made nice conversation  with me. Unfortunately both her boyfriend and her father were at the  party. I decided to move on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The place was more packed with people than I realized. The party  stretched into the room next door, and even outside to a large rooftop  balcony. This meant I could excuse myself from the claustrophobic room  full of strangers and revitalize myself with some fresh air and a  cigarette. \u201c&lt;em&gt;Where the hell was my friend?\u201d&lt;/em&gt; I kept wondering. I  checked up on him a couple times. I even reached out to a couple of  other friends to see if they wanted to stop by, but they were busy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Eventually my friend did show up, but he kept leaving for some  reason. I was a little pissed off to say the least, but this was still a  cool party and I had nothing better to do. So I stayed for a while and  decided I would try to fit in and have a good time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h4&gt;This is where things get weird.&lt;/h4&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I should have gone home. Instead I made small talk with a few people  and tried to fit in. I sipped on a couple beers and left my comfort zone  enough to talk to a few people. I tried talking to women, mostly. But  somehow I ended up being followed around by some older guy for the rest  of the night.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He seemed cool at first. We took a couple shots and talked about life  and family. His daughter was actually the hot roommate I talked about  earlier. He was a single middle-aged man trying to fit in with his  daughter\u2019s friends and people half his age. Clearly he must have felt  about as out of place as I did.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We took another shot. I was ready to call it quits and sober up for  the night. I still had to drive home later. But this guy wanted to rage  and handed me more shots. Now, totally drunk and needing to get away  from the peer pressure, I slipped out to the roof for another cigarette.  Maybe the cold air and nicotine would help me sober up a bit. By this  time I was totally messed up, though, and when some girl in the hallway  handed me a cookie I didn\u2019t hesitate to cram it in my mouth.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h4&gt;I shouldn\u2019t have eaten the cookie.&lt;/h4&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In case you\u2019re not following, this wasn\u2019t a regular cookie. It was a  special cookie, and I had a low tolerance it. So this time when the guy  managed to make his way outside and find me, I started to lose it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I didn\u2019t get violent or angry. No, I got paranoid. I can\u2019t remember  what he was saying to me, but he started really freaking me out. It was  probably nothing to worry about. I think he was probably talking about  his divorce or something normal like that. But I was suddenly terrified  and I had to leave immediately. I called my friend again, but he wasn\u2019t  around. I told him I had to leave.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I slipped away from the party as quickly and covertly as possible and  made my way back down the street to my car. There was no way in hell  that I should have been driving, but I was in a panic and I couldn\u2019t  stay there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I couldn\u2019t go home, either.

year is 1999, and the mysterious woman wakes up. The woman, slowly getting up, looks around, not aware of her whereabouts, the time, not even the year. As she looks around she notices a pool of blood in the middle of the brown carpet. She gets up disoriented, to go look in the bathroom mirror. She notices a faint scar on her forehead, she touches it, and sees a flash of light then collapses to the floor of the bathroom and is made unconscious, and a vision is seen. In this vision the woman sees a pentagram, drawn with blood on a marble floor, with candles on the corners and an unusual symbol in the middle of it. As unusual as it is, it seems familiar, looks like an upside down 7 next to another 7. The woman opens her eyes, regaining consciousness, and stands up, using the sink to support herself. She then looks at herself in the mirror again, her dark scarlet red hair all messy, and she appears to be light skinned, standing at around 5\u20195\u201d with a thin physique. she looks down from her face and notices she is nude and her hands covered in blood. She turns on the sink, running a slight stream of water and cleans the blood off her hands. To the right of her in the background of the mirror, she sees a door slightly cracked open, with a bed and a foot on the mattress. She turns around and walks towards the room, opening the door slowly, hearing the door creak open. When she enters the room she sees a woman, tied to the bed, wearing black lingerie and laying in a pool of blood, seemingly being her own, with her throat slit. The woman appears to be white with long brown hair, brown eyes and an average physique. The mysterious woman looks at the body and takes notice of the lingerie and feeling envious she says, \u201cDeath looks good on you, but your corpse won't be needing this anymore.\u201d The mysterious woman undresses the dead girl and heads to the bathroom to soak out the blood in the lingerie, then puts it on herself. Admiring herself in the mirror she notices a clock on the nightstand in the bedroom, she looks toward the clock which reads 3:00 A.M. in a neon green. The woman then again sees a flash of light and collapses to the floor. Another vision is seen, this time of a grandfather clock striking 3:00 am while seen in the reflection of the clock, slightly blurry, is a man tied up in the middle of a pentagram. The woman opens her eyes and picks herself up off the floor with a slight groan. She then heads to the front door of the apartment and leaves. Next to the front door was a calendar, the calendar being pinned on the month of July, and the year being 1999. The woman leaves the apartments and starts walking down an empty street like a stray dog, the surrounding buildings looking old, worn down or abandoned. As the woman is walking aimlessly she then again collapses to a flash of light and sees another vision. The woman sees only a dagger with the same strange symbol that was in the pentagram, engraved in the hilt. The symbol looking like an \u201cL7\u201d. \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The woman wakes up frantically, and notices she is no longer on the street, but in a bed. She looks to her right and sees a clock that reads 7:29 P.M. in red. A man dressed in an officers uniform is standing in the room and sets a chair up next to the bed sits down and says, \u201cGood you're awake.\u201d The woman sits up, looks at the man and asks, \u201cWhere am I?\u201d \u201cThe Man of Hope Hospital\u201d the officer says. The officer is an African American that is bald and has a goatee, brown eyes, and a fit physique. He then begins to speak again saying, \u201cNow that you're awake, I'd like to ask some questions. Starting with your name.\u201d \u201cMy name?\u201d the woman replies. \u201cYes, your name, what is it?\u201d says the officer sternly. The woman sits in silence, thinking for an answer to give the officer. Then she finally speaks up and says, \u201cAriel.\u201d \u201cOkay, and tell me Ariel, why were you wondering the streets at 4:00 a.m. in only your lingerie not even a block away from a crime scene, we have some of the clothing items you left at the scene in the storage room here so we know you were there. Are you an escort?\u201d The officer asks. \u201cNo.\u201d replies Ariel. \u201cNo, of course not.\u201d says the officer, staring at Ariel with suspicion. The officer looking at Ariel, scanning her from head to toe with his eyes then says, \u201cListen, you look like a nice girl, and I'd hate to turn a nice girl like you in... so lets make a deal.\u201d \u201cA deal?\u201d Ariel asks, \u201cWhat kind of deal?\u201d \u201cThe best kind.\u201d replies the officer with a smirk on his face. The officer leans in closer to Ariel, then kisses her neck. Ariel shocked by this action begins to feel a sense of arousal. The officer then hoists himself on top of Ariel and they begin to kiss vigorously. Ariel then swaps position with the officer, hoisting herself on top of him taking his handcuffs and cuffing him to the bed frame. Exposing herself from her guise, Ariel then takes the tip of a nearby IV bag and sticks it in the neck of the officer, piercing perfectly through the man's jugular vein. The man under shock, pulls out the tip and begins to spue blood all over the bed, himself, Ariel and the hospital floor. Ariel smiles, pleased with her sinful actions and watches as the officer gasps his last breath. She then gets out of the bed, exits the room and begins to run down the hallway. As she's running she sees another vision, this is of a white \u201cL\u201d like symbol, and she falls to the floor. Barely catching herself with her hands, she stands up and notices a room next to her labeled as, \u201cStorage\u201d. She opens the door and sees a box of clothes. In the box were a black bra and panties, black combat boots, black long socks, ripped black jeans, a black leather belt with white studs, a black crop top, black fingerless biker gloves and a black leather jacket with the white \u201cL\u201d symbol she just saw on the back of it. She feels a burning sensation on her left hand, she looks at her hand and burning through her hand was a strange rune that began to give off a dark purple hue. Ariel opened the palm of her hand and her hand began to give of the same purple hue. After a few seconds a black dagger with a purple aura was conjured into her hand. Ariel jumps back in shock dropping the dagger, and just before the dagger hits the ground it disappears. She opens her palm again, imagining the same dagger she just saw, and it reconjured into Ariel's hand. She drops the dagger again and this time tries to imagine something different, she tries to imagine a flame like what she saw on the candles in her vision, and in the middle of her hand was a purple ball of flame. Ariel closes her hand, amazed with her newfound abilities, and feeling a sense of augmentation. Just as Ariel begins to leave she sees a box of surgical masks and puts one on, knowing there are cameras throughout the Hospital. Ariel makes her way out the front of the Hospital, the Hospital being strangely empty with nobody even behind the front desk, and into a rather empty parking lot. One of the closest cars being a midnight blue 1994 mustang. She walks up and tries to open the door, but its locked. She looks at the lock on the door and opens her hand, imagining the key that is needed. The key is then conjured and Ariel successfully opens the door. Ariel sits in the driver's seat, closes the door and looks in the glove box. She discovers a Black Hawk 9mm handgun, a spare key, and a stack of legal papers. Ariel takes the gun and puts it in the passenger seat, and uses the spare key for the ignition. She then drives the car out of the Hospital parking lot and makes her way towards the nearby city.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Ariel drives through a brightly lit city with neon signs everywhere, the city, filled of sin and vice, reeked of Greed and Gluttony. One of the many stores Ariel drives by sells TV's and many other home appliances, on the TV's in the window it shows the apartment Ariel woke up in, with a news caption saying \u201cBreaking news: Murderer on the Loose, Search in Progress.\" Ariel hears a cops siren just a few car links behind her, and she pulls over into a nearby alley, turning off her car and laying her seat down. She eagerly watches as the cop rushes passed the alley entrance. Ariel laughs then notices her car is surrounded by three dark figures. Ariel reaches for the gun in the passenger seat but is pulled out of the car from the driver side, one of the figures opens the passenger door and grabs the gun. Ariel is thrown onto the floor and picks herself up to see three unknown men in front of her. As the men walk closer to her she tries backing away, but is grabbed from behind by another man who sticks a knife up to Ariels throat. The man laughs and says, \u201cGotcha! You ain't goin anywhere you pretty little thing!\u201d Ariel smirks and opens her hand on the man's thigh, engulfing him in black and purple flame. The man screams then shortly becomes a mere pile of ash and ember. The three men petrified are paralyzed from fear at the site of the man disintegrating in front of them. Ariel laughs, picks up the knife and smiles at the men, two of the men take a fearful step back while the one with the gun pulls up the gun to point at Ariel, but before he can fully extend Ariel slits the man's throat and takes the gun. The other two frantically turn and run, Ariel then throws the knife at one's back, knocking him to the floor, and the other trips on a trash can and tries to get back up. Ariel then conjures a hook and throws it at him, catching him by the shoulder she reels him quickly toward her. The man screams as Ariel catches him by the neck. Ariel pulls the gun up to the side of his head and pulls the trigger, flinging brain matter all over the alley wall and spurting blood onto Ariel's face. \u201cOh God, oh God, oh fucking shit!\u201d the man on the floor yells, trying to crawl away. Ariel slowly walks towards the man dropping the gun as she walks. \u201cOh my God, I'm so fucking sorry, please, please don't kill me I'm begging you!!!\u201d \u201cThere is no God here.\u201d replies Ariel opening her hand to conjure. But this time instead of conjuring pure energy, a chain with a hook flies from the left side of the alley, she opens her other hand and a chains flies from the right side of the alley. Ariel then digs both hooks under the man's shoulder blades. The chains pull back, lifting the man off the ground, \u201cAHHHHH!!! OHHH MY GODDD!!!\u201d The man shrieks for his life, as he slowly gets pulled apart by the chains. \u201cAHHHHHHH!!!\u201d The man lets out one final yell as you hear the fleshy tear of skin, muscle and veins, and the snap-cracking of bone as he gets pulled in half, his lifeless corpse hanging in the alley. \u201cF-freeze!!!\u201d Yell two cops from the entrance of the alley, Ariel grinning, opens her hand and the handgun flies towards her open hand. Ariel with extraordinary agility turns around firing two rounds towards the cops. Just as the bullets are about to connect to the authorities arteries, a wall of blinding light, outlined with a golden aura appears in front of them, making contact with the bullets. A golden lightning bolt strikes in front of the wall and a man, wearing white ripped jeans, white shoes, a black leather belt, and a white T-shirt with a black \u201c7\u201d on the back, appears out of the bolt. He has blonde hair, brown eyes, white skin, is around 5\u201910\u201d and has a athletic physique. The man turns and looks at Ariel. Ariel fires two rounds at the man and he lifts his hand, conjuring a gold plate of energy, and deflects both rounds. \u201cWho are you?\u201d Ariel asks. \u201cJohn, the representation of absolute virtue, and you are?\u201d says the man. \u201cWhy does it matter?\u201d replies Ariel. \u201cYou have too much pride Ariel, just thought I'd ask, I've been keeping track of a lot of your sins.\u201d says John. \u201cIf you already knew my name, then why\u2019d you ask?\u201d snaps Ariel. \u201cThought I'd be polite.\u201d John snaps back. \u201cAfter all, you and I are the same person.\u201d \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d replies Ariel, dumbfounded by what John had said. \u201cThe visions, you get them too do you not? How do you think I found you? It wasn't coincidence, you and I are connected. The pentagram, the dagger, the symbol. The man...do you not remember who that man was?\u201d Ariel gets a sharp pain in her temples and groans. She gets a vision of the man, a close up of him. He has short brown hair, white skin, and an average physique. He's blindfolded, ball gagged and shackled in the middle of a pentagram. The symbol \u201cL7\u201d written in blood on his torso. A man, wearing all black hooded robes and a plague doctor's mask takes the dagger Ariel saw in earlier visions. The grandfather clock strikes 3:00 am and the mysterious man takes the dagger and cuts the man in bondage down the middle of his torso, spilling everything he had inside. The mysterious man takes a bowl of the man's blood and puts it on a nearby altar made of granite. The man then begins to speak in something of another language, something of a hymn. Then a ring of fire appears around the pentagram and two bloody bodies are conjured, one male, one female. The vision stops but the pain still lingers in Ariel's temples. \u201cYou see, we are artificial, made of the same person, split by sin and virtue, you being pure sin, me being absolute virtue, and I'm here to reverse the effect. To become one again, and eliminate not only myself, but you as well, as abominations.\u201d says John. \u201cNo!\u201d Ariel replies \u201cI will never go back, never! I'm blood thirsty!\u201d Ariel's hands engulf in flame and she throws black fire at John. John dodges both blasts of fire with ease and runs at Ariel. Ariel goes to conjure a blade but as she does John tackles her, forcing her to drop the blade and unconjure it. Ariel kicks John off of her and swings at him hitting him in the chest. John staggers back and lets out a blast of white energy, knocking back Ariel. Ariel gets up and conjures two daggers, John takes action and conjures a white sword outlined with a golden aura. Ariel goes to attack John and John deflects several of Ariel's attacks. Ariel then is successful and strikes one of John's ribs, forcing John to yell. Ariel, seeing blood surface from John, smiles with bloodlust, and goes for the kill, aiming for his kidney. John catches the blade with his hand and breaks Ariel's arm. \u201cGAHHH!!!\u201d yells Ariel, staggering backward. Ariel grabs her arm and twists it, fixing the fracture John had caused. Filled with wrath, Ariel throws her dagger at John. John dodges, runs up to Ariel and kicks her in the gut, throwing her back about 25 feet. John then conjures his own dagger and throws it at Ariel as she's getting up, the hilt hits her and cuts her forehead. This has been the first time Ariel witnessed her own blood being presented. Ariel screams, covering her wound and looking up at John. John stands there patiently for Ariel's next move. Ariel looks at the hand she covered her wound with and it's covered in blood...her blood. Her hand begins to become luminescent with a crimson red. \u201cWhat the-? Oh no!\u201d John looks in shock and realizes the threat level of the situation, so he rushes towards Ariel. Ariel, not focusing on John puts her clean hand on the pavement, a ring of black fire engulfs around Ariel, stopping John from advancing. \u201cNO!\u201d John yells. Ariel then puts her bloody hand on the asphalt as well, conjuring a pentagram made of blood around Ariel. \u201cHmm...let's try this.\u201d says Ariel, uncertain but unreluctant. The space within the ring of fire emplodes, blasting everything within a block from the alley into ash, ember and flame and causing a blinding flash of light...\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...The year is 1999, and the mysterious woman wakes up. The woman, slowly getting up, looks around, not aware of her whereabouts, the time, not even the year. As she looks around she notices a pool of blood in the middle of the brown carpet. She gets up disoriented, to go look in the bathroom mirror. She notices a faint scar on her forehead. She sees behind her a clock on the bedroom nightstand, saying 3:00 A.M.

The woman, slowly getting up, looks around, not aware of her whereabouts, the time, not even the year. As she looks around she notices a pool of blood in the middle of the brown carpet. She gets up disoriented, to go look in the bathroom mirror. She notices a faint scar on her forehead, she touches it, and sees a flash of light then collapses to the floor of the bathroom and is made unconscious, and a vision is seen. In this vision the woman sees a pentagram, drawn with blood on a marble floor, with candles on the corners and an unusual symbol in the middle of it. As unusual as it is, it seems familiar, looks like an upside down 7 next to another 7. The woman opens her eyes, regaining consciousness, and stands up, using the sink to support herself. She then looks at herself in the mirror again, her dark scarlet red hair all messy, and she appears to be light skinned, standing at around 5\u20195\u201d with a thin physique. she looks down from her face and notices she is nude and her hands covered in blood. She turns on the sink, running a slight stream of water and cleans the blood off her hands. To the right of her in the background of the mirror, she sees a door slightly cracked open, with a bed and a foot on the mattress. She turns around and walks towards the room, opening the door slowly, hearing the door creak open. When she enters the room she sees a woman, tied to the bed, wearing black lingerie and laying in a pool of blood, seemingly being her own, with her throat slit. The woman appears to be white with long brown hair, brown eyes and an average physique. The mysterious woman looks at the body and takes notice of the lingerie and feeling envious she says, \u201cDeath looks good on you, but your corpse won&amp;#39;t be needing this anymore.\u201d The mysterious woman undresses the dead girl and heads to the bathroom to soak out the blood in the lingerie, then puts it on herself. Admiring herself in the mirror she notices a clock on the nightstand in the bedroom, she looks toward the clock which reads 3:00 A.M. in a neon green. The woman then again sees a flash of light and collapses to the floor. Another vision is seen, this time of a grandfather clock striking 3:00 am while seen in the reflection of the clock, slightly blurry, is a man tied up in the middle of a pentagram. The woman opens her eyes and picks herself up off the floor with a slight groan. She then heads to the front door of the apartment and leaves. Next to the front door was a calendar, the calendar being pinned on the month of July, and the year being 1999. The woman leaves the apartments and starts walking down an empty street like a stray dog, the surrounding buildings looking old, worn down or abandoned. As the woman is walking aimlessly she then again collapses to a flash of light and sees another vision. The woman sees only a dagger with the same strange symbol that was in the pentagram, engraved in the hilt. The symbol looking like an \u201cL7\u201d. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The woman wakes up frantically, and notices she is no longer on the street, but in a bed. She looks to her right and sees a clock that reads 7:29 P.M. in red. A man dressed in an officers uniform is standing in the room and sets a chair up next to the bed sits down and says, \u201cGood you&amp;#39;re awake.\u201d The woman sits up, looks at the man and asks, \u201cWhere am I?\u201d \u201cThe Man of Hope Hospital\u201d the officer says. The officer is an African American that is bald and has a goatee, brown eyes, and a fit physique. He then begins to speak again saying, \u201cNow that you&amp;#39;re awake, I&amp;#39;d like to ask some questions. Starting with your name.\u201d \u201cMy name?\u201d the woman replies. \u201cYes, your name, what is it?\u201d says the officer sternly. The woman sits in silence, thinking for an answer to give the officer. Then she finally speaks up and says, \u201cAriel.\u201d \u201cOkay, and tell me Ariel, why were you wondering the streets at 4:00 a.m. in only your lingerie not even a block away from a crime scene, we have some of the clothing items you left at the scene in the storage room here so we know you were there. Are you an escort?\u201d The officer asks. \u201cNo.\u201d replies Ariel. \u201cNo, of course not.\u201d says the officer, staring at Ariel with suspicion. The officer looking at Ariel, scanning her from head to toe with his eyes then says, \u201cListen, you look like a nice girl, and I&amp;#39;d hate to turn a nice girl like you in... so lets make a deal.\u201d \u201cA deal?\u201d Ariel asks, \u201cWhat kind of deal?\u201d \u201cThe best kind.\u201d replies the officer with a smirk on his face. The officer leans in closer to Ariel, then kisses her neck. Ariel shocked by this action begins to feel a sense of arousal. The officer then hoists himself on top of Ariel and they begin to kiss vigorously. Ariel then swaps position with the officer, hoisting herself on top of him taking his handcuffs and cuffing him to the bed frame. Exposing herself from her guise, Ariel then takes the tip of a nearby IV bag and sticks it in the neck of the officer, piercing perfectly through the man&amp;#39;s jugular vein. The man under shock, pulls out the tip and begins to spue blood all over the bed, himself, Ariel and the hospital floor. Ariel smiles, pleased with her sinful actions and watches as the officer gasps his last breath. She then gets out of the bed, exits the room and begins to run down the hallway. As she&amp;#39;s running she sees another vision, this is of a white \u201cL\u201d like symbol, and she falls to the floor. Barely catching herself with her hands, she stands up and notices a room next to her labeled as, \u201cStorage\u201d. She opens the door and sees a box of clothes. In the box were a black bra and panties, black combat boots, black long socks, ripped black jeans, a black leather belt with white studs, a black crop top, black fingerless biker gloves and a black leather jacket with the white \u201cL\u201d symbol she just saw on the back of it. She feels a burning sensation on her left hand, she looks at her hand and burning through her hand was a strange rune that began to give off a dark purple hue. Ariel opened the palm of her hand and her hand began to give of the same purple hue. After a few seconds a black dagger with a purple aura was conjured into her hand. Ariel jumps back in shock dropping the dagger, and just before the dagger hits the ground it disappears. She opens her palm again, imagining the same dagger she just saw, and it reconjured into Ariel&amp;#39;s hand. She drops the dagger again and this time tries to imagine something different, she tries to imagine a flame like what she saw on the candles in her vision, and in the middle of her hand was a purple ball of flame. Ariel closes her hand, amazed with her newfound abilities, and feeling a sense of augmentation. Just as Ariel begins to leave she sees a box of surgical masks and puts one on, knowing there are cameras throughout the Hospital. Ariel makes her way out the front of the Hospital, the Hospital being strangely empty with nobody even behind the front desk, and into a rather empty parking lot. One of the closest cars being a midnight blue 1994 mustang. She walks up and tries to open the door, but its locked. She looks at the lock on the door and opens her hand, imagining the key that is needed. The key is then conjured and Ariel successfully opens the door. Ariel sits in the driver&amp;#39;s seat, closes the door and looks in the glove box. She discovers a Black Hawk 9mm handgun, a spare key, and a stack of legal papers. Ariel takes the gun and puts it in the passenger seat, and uses the spare key for the ignition. She then drives the car out of the Hospital parking lot and makes her way towards the nearby city.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Ariel drives through a brightly lit city with neon signs everywhere, the city, filled of sin and vice, reeked of Greed and Gluttony. One of the many stores Ariel drives by sells TV&amp;#39;s and many other home appliances, on the TV&amp;#39;s in the window it shows the apartment Ariel woke up in, with a news caption saying \u201cBreaking news: Murderer on the Loose, Search in Progress.&amp;quot; Ariel hears a cops siren just a few car links behind her, and she pulls over into a nearby alley, turning off her car and laying her seat down. She eagerly watches as the cop rushes passed the alley entrance. Ariel laughs then notices her car is surrounded by three dark figures. Ariel reaches for the gun in the passenger seat but is pulled out of the car from the driver side, one of the figures opens the passenger door and grabs the gun. Ariel is thrown onto the floor and picks herself up to see three unknown men in front of her. As the men walk closer to her she tries backing away, but is grabbed from behind by another man who sticks a knife up to Ariels throat. The man laughs and says, \u201cGotcha! You ain&amp;#39;t goin anywhere you pretty little thing!\u201d Ariel smirks and opens her hand on the man&amp;#39;s thigh, engulfing him in black and purple flame. The man screams then shortly becomes a mere pile of ash and ember. The three men petrified are paralyzed from fear at the site of the man disintegrating in front of them. Ariel laughs, picks up the knife and smiles at the men, two of the men take a fearful step back while the one with the gun pulls up the gun to point at Ariel, but before he can fully extend Ariel slits the man&amp;#39;s throat and takes the gun. The other two frantically turn and run, Ariel then throws the knife at one&amp;#39;s back, knocking him to the floor, and the other trips on a trash can and tries to get back up. Ariel then conjures a hook and throws it at him, catching him by the shoulder she reels him quickly toward her. The man screams as Ariel catches him by the neck. Ariel pulls the gun up to the side of his head and pulls the trigger, flinging brain matter all over the alley wall and spurting blood onto Ariel&amp;#39;s face. \u201cOh God, oh God, oh fucking shit!\u201d the man on the floor yells, trying to crawl away. Ariel slowly walks towards the man dropping the gun as she walks. \u201cOh my God, I&amp;#39;m so fucking sorry, please, please don&amp;#39;t kill me I&amp;#39;m begging you!!!\u201d \u201cThere is no God here.\u201d replies Ariel opening her hand to conjure. But this time instead of conjuring pure energy, a chain with a hook flies from the left side of the alley, she opens her other hand and a chains flies from the right side of the alley. Ariel then digs both hooks under the man&amp;#39;s shoulder blades. The chains pull back, lifting the man off the ground, \u201cAHHHHH!!! OHHH MY GODDD!!!\u201d The man shrieks for his life, as he slowly gets pulled apart by the chains. \u201cAHHHHHHH!!!\u201d The man lets out one final yell as you hear the fleshy tear of skin, muscle and veins, and the snap-cracking of bone as he gets pulled in half, his lifeless corpse hanging in the alley. \u201cF-freeze!!!\u201d Yell two cops from the entrance of the alley, Ariel grinning, opens her hand and the handgun flies towards her open hand. Ariel with extraordinary agility turns around firing two rounds towards the cops. Just as the bullets are about to connect to the authorities arteries, a wall of blinding light, outlined with a golden aura appears in front of them, making contact with the bullets. A golden lightning bolt strikes in front of the wall and a man, wearing white ripped jeans, white shoes, a black leather belt, and a white T-shirt with a black \u201c7\u201d on the back, appears out of the bolt. He has blonde hair, brown eyes, white skin, is around 5\u201910\u201d and has a athletic physique. The man turns and looks at Ariel. Ariel fires two rounds at the man and he lifts his hand, conjuring a gold plate of energy, and deflects both rounds. \u201cWho are you?\u201d Ariel asks. \u201cJohn, the representation of absolute virtue, and you are?\u201d says the man. \u201cWhy does it matter?\u201d replies Ariel. \u201cYou have too much pride Ariel, just thought I&amp;#39;d ask, I&amp;#39;ve been keeping track of a lot of your sins.\u201d says John. \u201cIf you already knew my name, then why\u2019d you ask?\u201d snaps Ariel. \u201cThought I&amp;#39;d be polite.\u201d John snaps back. \u201cAfter all, you and I are the same person.\u201d \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d replies Ariel, dumbfounded by what John had said. \u201cThe visions, you get them too do you not? How do you think I found you? It wasn&amp;#39;t coincidence, you and I are connected. The pentagram, the dagger, the symbol. The man...do you not remember who that man was?\u201d Ariel gets a sharp pain in her temples and groans. She gets a vision of the man, a close up of him. He has short brown hair, white skin, and an average physique. He&amp;#39;s blindfolded, ball gagged and shackled in the middle of a pentagram. The symbol \u201cL7\u201d written in blood on his torso. A man, wearing all black hooded robes and a plague doctor&amp;#39;s mask takes the dagger Ariel saw in earlier visions.

The mysterious man takes a bowl of the man&amp;#39;s blood and puts it on a nearby altar made of granite. The man then begins to speak in something of another language, something of a hymn. Then a ring of fire appears around the pentagram and two bloody bodies are conjured, one male, one female. The vision stops but the pain still lingers in Ariel&amp;#39;s temples. \u201cYou see, we are artificial, made of the same person, split by sin and virtue, you being pure sin, me being absolute virtue, and I&amp;#39;m here to reverse the effect. To become one again, and eliminate not only myself, but you as well, as abominations.\u201d says John. \u201cNo!\u201d Ariel replies \u201cI will never go back, never! I&amp;#39;m blood thirsty!\u201d Ariel&amp;#39;s hands engulf in flame and she throws black fire at John. John dodges both blasts of fire with ease and runs at Ariel. Ariel goes to conjure a blade but as she does John tackles her, forcing her to drop the blade and unconjure it. Ariel kicks John off of her and swings at him hitting him in the chest. John staggers back and lets out a blast of white energy, knocking back Ariel. Ariel gets up and conjures two daggers, John takes action and conjures a white sword outlined with a golden aura. Ariel goes to attack John and John deflects several of Ariel&amp;#39;s attacks. Ariel then is successful and strikes one of John&amp;#39;s ribs, forcing John to yell. Ariel, seeing blood surface from John, smiles with bloodlust, and goes for the kill, aiming for his kidney. John catches the blade with his hand and breaks Ariel&amp;#39;s arm. \u201cGAHHH!!!\u201d yells Ariel, staggering backward. Ariel grabs her arm and twists it, fixing the fracture John had caused. Filled with wrath, Ariel throws her dagger at John. John dodges, runs up to Ariel and kicks her in the gut, throwing her back about 25 feet. John then conjures his own dagger and throws it at Ariel as she&amp;#39;s getting up, the hilt hits her and cuts her forehead. This has been the first time Ariel witnessed her own blood being presented. Ariel screams, covering her wound and looking up at John. John stands there patiently for Ariel&amp;#39;s next move. Ariel looks at the hand she covered her wound with and it&amp;#39;s covered in blood...her blood. Her hand begins to become luminescent with a crimson red. \u201cWhat the-? Oh no!\u201d John looks in shock and realizes the threat level of the situation, so he rushes towards Ariel. Ariel, not focusing on John puts her clean hand on the pavement, a ring of black fire engulfs around Ariel, stopping John from advancing. \u201cNO!\u201d John yells. Ariel then puts her bloody hand on the asphalt as well, conjuring a pentagram made of blood around Ariel. \u201cHmm...let&amp;#39;s try this.\u201d says Ariel, uncertain but unreluctant. The space within the ring of fire emplodes, blasting everything within a block from the alley into ash, ember and flame and causing a blinding flash of light...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...The year is 1999, and the mysterious woman wakes up. The woman, slowly getting up, looks around, not aware of her whereabouts, the time, not even the year. As she looks around she notices a pool of blood in the middle of the brown carpet. She gets up disoriented, to go look in the bathroom mirror. She notices a faint scar on her forehead. She sees behind her a clock on the bedroom nightstand, saying 3:00 A.M. She looks back at herself, and smiles...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "36bc2024-016e-11e4-94a6-12313b01ac51", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qi02", "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "9sab7w", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Riftocity", "num_crossposts": 0, "num_comments": 1, "send_replies": true, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/stories/comments/9sab7w/seven_seven/", "whitelist_status": null, "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/9sab7w/seven_seven/", "subreddit_subscribers": 7162, "created_utc": 1540790169.0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "stories", "selftext": "  As I sit on my couch and turn on 9NEWS, my heart begins to race. The bold headline states that there is a hostage situation somewhere in the country, and police cannot seem to find the location. A video feed from the kidnapper comes in. A woman can be seen in the grainy video. Hands can be seen adjusting the focus until it lands perfectly on the woman\u2019s face. My heart skips a beat as I recognise my wife, her usually radiant face dishevelled and tired. Her hands seem to be tied to the ceiling and her feet are bound together. My own hands numbing at the thoughts of the things I would do the kidnapper if I ever crossed him. \n\nThe kidnapper comes on-screen, his face covered by a clown mask and his hands covered in leather gauntlets to seemingly cover hints of his age. He seems to be clad in an old-fashioned detective cape with a top hat. He begins to speak, his words rolling off his tongue in a heavy accent. \u2018You have 24 hours until this woman dies. If you try to retrieve her, she will be killed immediately\u2019. As he says this, he gestures to a timer on his right, the digits flashing 24:00:00 repeatedly, like a death toll, before beginning its countdown.\n\nI turn off the TV and jump off the sofa, trying to call 911 and alert them. But they seem to have beaten me, as I hear a sharp rap on the door just before a gruff, old voice calls out \u2018Police! Open up!\u2019. I run over and hurriedly unlock the door, denying them the chance to break it open. A gaggle of grown men in baby blue bulletproof vests face me, the ones in the rear flashing guns at me while the front line flashes their CID badges with a bored, if not completely uninterested, manner.\n\nI begin to sweat, scared that they have tagged me as a suspect and scared that they might waste time interrogating me, and ultimately, letting my wife die. I get on my knees and beg them for help amongst teary sobs. \u2018Now that\u2019s a weird one if I\u2019ve ever seen one.\u2019 A Wild Western accent gave him a slightly nasal voice to accompany his cowboy face. He helps me up, and I spot the badge on his breast-pocket. It read: DI TOM THORNE. I quake in fear as he gestures towards my couch to interrogate me.\n\nThey ask me about my wife, how much I loved her and her daily behaviour. They ask me about her relationships outside of work and her friends. They ask me about the intense argument we had in the morning, about all that I said and did to her. They rake through my mind about everything I knew about her and any of her correspondences. They ultimately ruled me as innocent, for an empty vessel holds nothing. \n\nAs they get up to leave with some of my wife\u2019s belongings, I ask for permission to participate in the investigation. DI Thorne promptly turns me down with the simple explanation of being \u201ctoo close to the victim\u201d. They leave without any fuss, as all federal agents do, I suppose. I\u2019m left feeling sick in the stomach before realising that a few hours had passed, leaving less time till her supposed death. \n\nI switch on the TV, but the broadcast shows nothing. I panic and switch to my phone, immediately turning to the internet denizens via Google Chrome. The moment the app is open, I am rerouted to a dodgy black website that only asks one question: \n\nARE YOU JOHN DOE?\n\n \u25a2YES  \u25a2NO\n\nI promptly check YES and find myself looking at my wife. This time, naked. She is still hanging by her wrists, though she seems to have regained consciousness. She silently mouths \u2018HELP\u2019 and looks at the floor, wildly gesturing with her eyes. As I follow her gaze, a sharp pain explodes through my body as I see the bruises on her body, especially around her midriff and d\u00e9colletage. My eyes tear up at the sight and clear just as quickly as the man enters.\n\nHe still seemed to be clad in his odd costume of a detective clown. His proximity, however, reveals the faded colours of the mask and the cracks in it. His sleeve seems to be slightly pulled back, revealing mottled yellow skin. He seems to have noticed my gaze and tugs it down to partly cover his glove once again. \u2018I said that I would give you 24 hours before I killed her, but I never said I wouldn\u2019t ravage her.\u2019 His words seem to spark an animalistic rage within me, adrenaline pouring through my veins as my mind begins to form horrible torture methods for this man. \n\nMy throat closes up as he stalks towards her, my blood boiling as he reaches his hand towards her, closing on her \u4e00\n\nHis gesture is cut off as I promptly close the app and open the Clock app to begin a 20-hour timer. I stare at the blinking lights of the timer as it goes off, it\u2019s every erratic flash like my heartbeat. I think of all the different ways I could track him down and decide to first take a look at my wife\u2019s workplace. \n\nI leave the house, starting my Toyota Corolla while cursing its slow speed. I drive to her work in a mad frenzy, my mind mentally counting the minutes it took me to reach the place. As I pull in, I am greeted by the security guard gesturing towards the gate, telling me to leave. In a rustic voice he says that my wife had left around 4 and a half hours ago. \n\nA quick check of the timer reveals that the man must have either picked her up and taken her to the place or kidnapped her one her way home, allowing 20 minutes for all of it to happen, give or take a few minutes. A map comes up in my mind, and I check the speed limit of the surrounding area. Most of the roads have a 60km/h speed limit while one road has a 100km/h speed limit. The highway seemed impossible as there was only one exit, and it was a half an hour\u2019s drive from here. After a quick preliminary elimination, I narrow it down to 3 roads: Hyde Lane, Chinatown, and Lincoln Street.\n\nFrom what me and my wife had seen of Chinatown, it seemed impossible that such a place could house a would-be murderer. The streets were too crowded and noisy, and the Chinese New Year\u2019s celebrations were too colourful to not have filtered into the room. It leaves me with two options: Hyde Lane and Lincoln Street. \n\nI make my way towards Lincoln Street, the street where my apartment was conveniently located. My phone suddenly dings, and two messages came from my wife\u2019s phone number. One of an image, and one text message, respectively. I unlock the phone with high hopes and read the message. QUICK, QUICK. I DON\u2019T THINK SHE CAN LAST MUCH LONGER. ;). The picture was of my wife, nude and battered. Her face didn\u2019t seem to be damaged, and neither did her limbs. All the bruises were at the midriff and chest. My heart begins to flutter, and I unlock the phone, going back to Google Chrome, expecting to see my wife, but greeted with the kidnapper\u2019s face instead. \u2018Keep your eyes on the road, Johnny Boy, we don\u2019t wanna ruin the fun too early now, do we?\u2019\n\nMy hands shake on the wheel, my grip growing increasingly unsteady as I realise that he might have seen me talking to the security guard, and possibly might have even heard me. I pull over, dazed, and confused, scared to drive in fear of a crash. My head spins as my gaze is stolen by the headlights of passing cars that disappear just as quickly over the horizon. My heart thunders in my chest as my mid registers a dark, limping figure clad in a coat walking towards me. As I lose feeling in my limbs, a stark whiteness comes over me, the only colourful thing I see, my wife\u2019s battered body.\n\n*Wake up, John*\n\n*Johnnnnny boy. Wake up. Wouldn\u2019t want to miss the fun, do you?*\n\n*J O H N!*\n\nI wake up, a bright light hanging over my head, blocking my view. From the corner of my eye, I spot the hooded figure, my body breaking out in a cold sweat as he nears me. As he gets closer, I realise it\u2019s the killer, this time my blood boils and a pump of adrenaline forces me to move my hands. They\u2019re strapped. I try to move my legs and chest instead, only to find them in the same state. I crane my neck to get a better view, only to once again be restrained by the straps. I lower my eyes as far as I can, and spot leather restraints over my wrists and ankles, my chest and waist constrained by the same contraption. I can feel cool, damp leather straps over my neck and head, pinning me down.\n\nI stifle a giggle at the absurdity of it all. My wife and I kidnapped and killed on the same day. I could picture the headlines: MAN GOES AFTER KIDNAPPED WIFE, ONLY TO DIE ALONGSIDE HER. I would have laughed aloud if my jaw wasn\u2019t clamped shut. The argument from the morning plays back in my head, like a grotesque version of a death song as my eyelids clamp shut.\n\n*\u201cWhy were you out the whole night?\u201d*\n\n*\u2018I can come and go whenever I wish, can\u2019t I? I am your wife, not some harlot that you have invited into your house.\u2019*\n\n*\u201cWhy did you go to Parker\u2019s house?\u2019*\n\n*\u2018I-I-I\u2026 I just passed by it that\u2019s all. I don\u2019t even know who and what you\u2019re talking about.\u2019*\n\n*\u201cLies, lies. I cannot believe you would cheat on me with that, that, that mongrel.\u201d*\n\n*\u2018I never slept with him and just to be clear, he is an exceptionally good man.\u2019*\n\n*\u201cI thought you said you said you had never heard of him before.\u2019\u2019*\n\n*\u201cBu-bu-but\u2026\u201d  (A sharp crack is heard in the blackness)*\n\nMy mind clears, and I see the man closer to me, a musky scent emanating from him, getting more intense the closer he gets. I suddenly realise that my wife is nowhere to be seen, my heart begins beating an erratic pattern once again. The man, clearly having seen my distress, speaks in a condescending voice. \u2018Don\u2019t worry. Your wife will be here soon enough.\u2019\n\nMy heart lurches at that. I think that my wife is safe, but the hours spent reading mystery books tells my mind otherwise. I calculate different ways to escape, the various routes and potential weapons flooding my mind as my heart begins to flutter once more. \u2018Be careful, Parker. Don\u2019t taunt him too much. His heart condition will flare up again and he will end too soon. We don\u2019t want that now, do we?\u2019 Her voice floats from the other side of the room, cold and razor sharp, like a king giving the execution grant. As he turns to face her, I spot a line on his neck that separated very fair skin and mottled yellow skin. I realise that it is makeup, and that the clown mask isn\u2019t really a mask, but more of a face painting. \n\nI dare a look at my wife, resplendent in her gown and make-up. A question keeps playing in my head, *Why?* I couldn\u2019t understand why she could do this, why she would team up with that no-good Parker. As I black out once again, I hear the voices of Parker and my wife as they rush toward me. \n\n*\u201cI don\u2019t want to see you near me and my wife again.\u201d*\n\n*\u2018But I am your friend, John. Have been for the past few years now. Surely a minor accident couldn\u2019t have changed that. Surely, I am worth more than my face and arms.\u2019*\n\n*\u201cLook at you, Park. You don\u2019t even look like a man anymore. I don\u2019t want any of my future children to think I am friends with idiots such as you!\u201d*\n\n*\u2018John, livedo reticularis is not something that I can get. It was apparently genetic. I can\u2019t change that, can I now John? Even your children could ha\u2014\u2019*\n\nI snap awake and immediately regret it. Parker\u2019s mask is washed-off and the bluish-veins on his face stand out in the pale, white light. I don\u2019t pay attention to my wife, fearing that I may feel sympathy for her even though she seems to be the mastermind behind it all. I sneak a glance anyway, and I see their hands clasped together, grinning at me sadistically in unison. My heart sinks and my mind seems to retreat into the deepest recess of my brain.\n\nI seem to be viewing the world through a pair of binoculars. I spot a metal plate next to my bed, filled with wickedly sharp surgical instruments. In this dark recess, I seem to feel no fear or pain, withdrawn as I am. My mind prepares for pain of the scalpel as Parker and she lift the scalpel and plier, respectively. I seem to have already been betrayed by whom I have regarded as the closest to me. Surely, no pain could be greater than that. *Why didn\u2019t I just kill her when I had the chance?*", "author_fullname": "t2_1lwr0aef", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "John's Wife", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/stories", "hidden": false, "pwls": null, "link_flair_css_class": "purple", "downs": 0, "parent_whitelist_status": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_9sas6n", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3, "domain": "self.stories", "media_embed": {}, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Fiction", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 3, "approved_by": null, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1540824286.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "contest_mode": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I sit on my couch and turn on 9NEWS, my heart begins to race.

I don\u2019t even know who and what you\u2019re talking about.\u2019&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;\u201cLies, lies. I cannot believe you would cheat on me with that, that, that mongrel.\u201d&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;\u2018I never slept with him and just to be clear, he is an exceptionally good man.\u2019&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;\u201cI thought you said you said you had never heard of him before.\u2019\u2019&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;\u201cBu-bu-but\u2026\u201d  (A sharp crack is heard in the blackness)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My mind clears, and I see the man closer to me, a musky scent emanating from him, getting more intense the closer he gets. I suddenly realise that my wife is nowhere to be seen, my heart begins beating an erratic pattern once again. The man, clearly having seen my distress, speaks in a condescending voice. \u2018Don\u2019t worry. Your wife will be here soon enough.\u2019&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My heart lurches at that. I think that my wife is safe, but the hours spent reading mystery books tells my mind otherwise. I calculate different ways to escape, the various routes and potential weapons flooding my mind as my heart begins to flutter once more. \u2018Be careful, Parker. Don\u2019t taunt him too much. His heart condition will flare up again and he will end too soon. We don\u2019t want that now, do we?\u2019 Her voice floats from the other side of the room, cold and razor sharp, like a king giving the execution grant. As he turns to face her, I spot a line on his neck that separated very fair skin and mottled yellow skin. I realise that it is makeup, and that the clown mask isn\u2019t really a mask, but more of a face painting. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I dare a look at my wife, resplendent in her gown and make-up. A question keeps playing in my head, &lt;em&gt;Why?&lt;/em&gt; I couldn\u2019t understand why she could do this, why she would team up with that no-good Parker. As I black out once again, I hear the voices of Parker and my wife as they rush toward me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;\u201cI don\u2019t want to see you near me and my wife again.\u201d&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;\u2018But I am your friend, John. Have been for the past few years now. Surely a minor accident couldn\u2019t have changed that. Surely, I am worth more than my face and arms.\u2019&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;\u201cLook at you, Park. You don\u2019t even look like a man anymore. I don\u2019t want any of my future children to think I am friends with idiots such as you!\u201d&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;\u2018John, livedo reticularis is not something that I can get. It was apparently genetic. I can\u2019t change that, can I now John? Even your children could ha\u2014\u2019&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I snap awake and immediately regret it. Parker\u2019s mask is washed-off and the bluish-veins on his face stand out in the pale, white light. I don\u2019t pay attention to my wife, fearing that I may feel sympathy for her even though she seems to be the mastermind behind it all. I sneak a glance anyway, and I see their hands clasped together, grinning at me sadistically in unison. My heart sinks and my mind seems to retreat into the deepest recess of my brain.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I seem to be viewing the world through a pair of binoculars. I spot a metal plate next to my bed, filled with wickedly sharp surgical instruments. In this dark recess, I seem to feel no fear or pain, withdrawn as I am. My mind prepares for pain of the scalpel as Parker and she lift the scalpel and plier, respectively. I seem to have already been betrayed by whom I have regarded as the closest to me. Surely, no pain could be greater than that. &lt;em&gt;Why didn\u2019t I just kill her when I had the chance?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "36bc2024-016e-11e4-94a6-12313b01ac51", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qi02", "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "9sas6n", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "LucierEmpire", "num_crossposts": 0, "num_comments": 0, "send_replies": true, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/stories/comments/9sas6n/johns_wife/", "whitelist_status": null, "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/9sas6n/johns_wife/", "subreddit_subscribers": 7162, "created_utc": 1540795486.0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "stories", "selftext": "Sonia and Maddy were involved in a hit and run two years ago.
