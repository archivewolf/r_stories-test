                        "selftext": "Sorry this is so long, I think you might like it though.\n\nHello again people, sorry I didn't answer any of you in the comments of my last post, I tried my best to answer the PM's in the following days after the post, but I didn't get around to everyone, so I'm sorry about that. I had some work and family issues to deal with (completely unrelated to this but it kinda did affect us all), my father was taken ill and is now in a care home. He's stable and doing OK but it definitely threw of plans I had and stopped me from answering questions and updating you all on everything.\n\nSo, it was a mixed bag in the comments but I decided to go with my gut and go with the hidden cameras, as I said at the end of the previous post. I did my research, and made sure they were on a card in my name, that I bought them with a bunch of different stuff (I had a few bike repair items to order so I got them in the same order) and made sure no one has access to my Amazon account (don't have prime and I'm the only one who has access). When they arrived, they were in fairly plain boxes and I burnt the paper receipt (we have an old house with an open fire, I made sure to do it whilst no one was looking).\n\nI then set up the cameras, which was easier said than done. I bought 4 cameras (not cheap, and I won't say what brand they are, I'm sorry), one for our bedroom, one for the living room, one for the kitchen and one for my son's bedroom. Now I really hated putting them all in, but I was almost physically sick when I put the one in my son's bedroom because it was just so bad in my head. I decided to put it somewhere where it wouldn't see him sleeping but would see who entered the room. The other three were pointed at the entire room so I could see what was going on. They were all recording onto micro sd cards and are in no way connected to the internet.\n\nThey're all motion sensor detected, and if no motion is detected for 30 seconds it stops recording. I was ready, the camera in our bedroom was easy, just grab it and get the footage off, the ones in the kitchen and the living room were a little harder, but did them when everyone else was in bed every other night (they have a good amount of data so they last a long time). The hardest one was in my son's room, but he goes out with his friends in the evenings every week or so (about the time the card usually last for).\n\nSo, I supposed I should get to what I saw on there, seeing as though I'm making this post. And not to get your hopes up, I didn't see them both fucking, believe me, I would have lead with that, but I did see something, so I'll get to that.\n\nMost of the footage was just us all going about our day, that was all the boring stuff. My son still hasn't found a job, so a lot of it is just him around the house. I did find him masturbating in the living room a few times though, weird to watch that, but I just skipped over it. When it came to when my wife and son were alone in the house together, I could see what they were doing, but only hear what they were talking about maybe 60% of the time.\n\nNow, in all of this, with the camera being in place for just under 2 weeks, I have about 4 incidences of something (I have a secure account somewhere online where I keep all these videos and notes), with the most recent of which being yesterday, as of typing this.\n\n**16th September** - Now, this was just a small incident and was the day after I set up the cameras. I was in and out of the house for most of the day, I was doing some minor DIY on the house in the spare bedroom, so they had the chance to be alone for a lot of the daytime. My wife did what she was doing in the day and went to sit in the living room to catch up on some of her soap operas for the week.\n\nOur son then enters the room about 40 minutes later and sits down with her. They talk over the TV, so the audio is not good and I can't hear what they're saying. after about 10 minutes of our son coming in, my wife then does reaches for something and our son is just staring at her ass. She turns around and he looks away, it's obvious that she reprimands him. I can't hear what they're saying but they both laugh a little and just go back to the show. A little while later, she goes to get a drink and pauses it. When she comes back, she takes her time placing her drink, and her ass is very much level with my sons eyeline. He looks and she catches him, this time I can just make out what they're saying.\n\n\"Are you looking at my ass, again?\"\n\n\"Sorry, I can't help it.\"\n\n\"I'm not *inaudible*, you can, just don't get caught.\"\n\n\"OK, I'll try not to.\"\n\nThey both laugh and go back to the TV.\n\n**18th September** - So I was away for work on this day and the following day, so in the evening it was just the two of them in the house. They were in the kitchen at this time and this is perhaps the worst place for things to happen, because (without describing it too in detail) the camera is behind some dark glass (part of the design of the kitchen), so it's much darker and no sound, but it was the only place to put it. So, they're both heading to bed, my wife is making a hot drink and our son is just getting some water, but he decides to stay and chat. He's in shorts and that's it and she's in her underwear and t-shirt.\n\nI can't hear what they're saying, but they're leant on the counter quite close to each other just muttering, and laughing at what they're saying. Then, as my son leave, my wife hits his ass as he's walking away. He laughs and she turns around as if she didn't do it. Then he does it to him and she laughs. He then leaves quickly with a loud enough for the camera to pick it up\n\n\"Night Mother.\"\n\n**19th September** -   Now this happens the day after the one I just talked about and might be the least eventful, but I thought I'd include it because of a small detail.  My son gets up earlier than normal (he drags himself out of bed at noonish most days) and decided to go to our room before my wife leaves for work. He went to ask her about how our doctors work and if he needed to sign up (he asks after what happens). \n\nHe decided to open the door to our bedroom and my wife is getting changed in there. she was presently topless with trousers on. The main thing that gets me is that although there is a little bit of back and forth between them about sorry for not knocking, and so on, it takes my wife a good 15 seconds to cover her breasts. I liked it, but I could tell it was a bit of a shock for both of them.\n\n**26th September** - So our son is currently playing through the Spider-Man game at the moment, which means he's in the living room more than he usually is (we keep our PS4 in the front room because I play some games). He was in there yesterday when my wife got home and went to change for one of her dance classes. She used to go to a later on but goes to an earlier one because she wants to get to sleep earlier on Wednesdays (this class finished at 9 and she was home for 9:45 and watched something, then heads to bed, so it was about 11 when she got to bed, and she has to get up very early on Thursdays).\n\nThis time, she got dressed and come downstairs and asked our son something. He pauses the game and she asks again, this time I get what she said.\n\n\"Can you help me stretch out? I normally do it myself, but if you make yourself useful I can actually do it properly.\"\n\nOur son basically agrees instantly and stands up eager to go, he's wearing jeans and a t-shirt, but she explains all he has to do is hold her in place on the harder stretches. Now, I've done this with my wife before, and I can tell you, it's really hot. I basically get to see her up close and love it, I normally give her some kisses on her ass and stomach ever now and then to make her happy and so that she fucks me when she gets home.\n\nWatching them do this (sans kissing her stomach and ass), it was obvious they were both enjoying it, and it went on for a while. My wife then left saying, \n\n\"Well, funs over now. I have to go.\"\n\nMy son then watched her leave, and say on the couch and jacked off. I was a little shocked (not overly, but a little) that he did it almost immediately afterwards. After he finished, he went upstairs and cleaned himself up. That night (last night), me and my wife had amazing sex, she initiated, it was only today I found out about what happened.\n\nSo there you have it, that's it. Sorry, this is so long, but I wanted to fully update you all on this. I'd appreciate some help with what to do next. As I say, I'd love for them to get together, so if you can advise me, that would be great.",
