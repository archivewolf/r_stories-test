First day, they were flirty and happy around each other. We all went to bed late and I wanted to see if my suspicions were true so I went to the bathroom around 2am. The door to their room has a small window at the side so I quickly looked through. It had blinds but I could see through the holes regardless. They were asleep. I felt both disappointed and relieved. It made me wonder if I even wanted to see them as a couple.\n\nNext day, they weren't even flirty around each other. Having said that we all went to bed late and woke up early, so we were tired. Around 4pm they went for a nap, then got ready for dinner around 7pm. Seemed a lot cheerier, excited even. We went to bed earlier this time, around 11:30. I waited for about an hour before checking on them. I could see a light through the window's blinds. I also heard them laughing. I stood for a good few minutes wondering if I should look through the window. I ultimately did.\n\nMy mom and uncle were stark naked facing each other on the side. I couldn't fully see but they were 100% having sex. I stayed for a while. Everything was a blur due to mixed emotions so I don't remember everything I saw. I remember them cuddling and the clasp on mom's watch somehow got caught on my uncle's necklace and they laughed about it. Anyway I remember going back to my room in a daze.\n\nNext few days things were back to \"normal\". Mom and uncle acted the same way, only now I knew what they were truly doing. Mom even asked me why I was quiet. I didn't want to spy on them again. I was temped like hell but I didn't. Both out of fear and respect.\n\nOn the way home I sort of studied the whole thing. Like I said in my previous post, I still think it's incredibly erotic. I really want them to know that I know and that I'm fine with them being together. I'd prefer them to just act as a couple in my presence instead of sneaking around me.\n\nEdit: Several people messaged me asking what they look like, so I might as well let it out. Mom looks like a \"plump\" Amy Poehler and my uncle looks like a (more) muscular Joe Manganiello.",
