The other day she was showing some cleavage and all day I couldn\u2019t get her off of my mind fantasizing about her. Almost a week later I\u2019m still thinking about it. How could I get closer to her, have her feel more comfortable around me but not seem as if all I want is to be intimate I know it\u2019s crazy but I feel like she also has an intimate urge with me as well plus not having anyone notice it. How do I make her more comfortable around me so she can dress less modest a couple of weeks ago we all went to a party didn\u2019t drink to drive back safely we decided to come back to our place and drink there her boyfriend and my gf fell asleep early so we went to the living room to keep drinking and watch movies she payed on the couch I just sat next to her after a couple of drinks she got tired and got a blanket and she looked so adorable I couldn\u2019t help but  caress her head with my hands moving her hair out of her face she looked at me and smiled then kept watching the movie I then built up the courage and asked if she wanted a massage. She nodded yes, my heart started to race instantly but I kept calm and slowly went under her dress and started to massage her neck leading to her back I would get really close to her butt and her boobs but she didn\u2019t stop me nor give me any signal that she was uncomfortable as a got closer to her butt I noticed she wasn\u2019t wearing panties and I got so aroused but I couldn\u2019t reach lower due to me sitting and not wanting to be too forward so I gave up on the butt massage so then I got closer to her boobs but this was so fast I didn\u2019t want to ruin anything and it seemed like she was falling asleep so I stopped there and went to bed. Any ideas how I can get that to happen again or have a talk with her on whether she feels the same way and at the same time not ruining everything? ",
