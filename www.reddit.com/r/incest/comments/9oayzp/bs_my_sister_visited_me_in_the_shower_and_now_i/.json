It's been about a week or so since all this happened now and I've had a good amount of time to digest it and discuss everything with Ashley and Sarah a little more. So it's probably better it took this long anyway! Regardless, sorry for this being later than I intended! I know I told a few people I'd try to have it up within a few days of meeting with Sarah, so that's my bad.\n\nDiving right in, last Saturday was a long day. I didn't know what to expect really going into it, but it turned into a drama-filled conversation that we wound up not being able to complete in one sitting. Sunday got nuked as well because I still had to go back to my Mom's, after finishing this discussion up, to drop off Ashley and pickup the rest of my stuff along with a few things that my Mom had bought for us to put in the new place. My weekend got torpedoed pretty quickly!\n\nI'll begin with a disclaimer of sorts about Sarah: she will always be my big sister, so I will always support her in the end no matter what because we are family. But she has a lot of shitty views that stem from her own negative experiences in life. There was a lot of other excess baggage surrounding her getting pregnant and having a kid really young. The details are necessary, but they effected her view of love, relationships, and men particularly, in a very negative way. Her views on stuff like that have become very pessimistic. Because of that, combined with the added mountain of a relationship between Ashley and I to climb, her attitude wound up making this conversation more difficult than it needed to be, especially at first.\n\nI left my new place in the morning and started the long drive back home to pick up Ashley. The plan was to meet Sarah at a little out-of-the-way diner that we've gone to before about halfway to her place (~2 hours from my Mom's). I hoped that the public setting would keep everyone's emotions in check. In reality we should have just started at Sarah's house or somewhere else more private even though it was farther. More on that later though.\n\nOn the ride, before I picked up Ashley, I called Sarah. I decided it would be a good idea to have a quick chat with Sarah before we arrived, and before her and Ashley were together in the same room together, based on the last phone call. And yes, I told Ashley I would be doing that. Sarah answered quickly.\n\n**Sarah:** \"Hey.\"\n\n**Me:** \"Hey. So I am on my way. I should be there a little after noon.\"\n\n**Sarah:** \"Ok. We are going to (diner name) right?\"\n\n**Me:** \"Yeah. I called and asked them to reserve us a table for lunch, not that we should need it.\"\n\n**Sarah:** K.\n\nHer voice was flat. I couldn't really gauge what she was thinking or feeling. She was fun when we were younger but as she got older, and her life got more complicated, it's gotten less and less common for that side of her to come out. She is a smoker, so I heard her light up a cigarette on the other end, which meant she was outside (she doesn't smoke indoors because of the kids) away from her girlfriend and kids.\n\n**Me:** \"I didn't just call to tell you I was on my way. I was hoping we could talk quick about a few things before we get there.\"\n\nSarah just made a grunting noise like \"Hmph\", which I assumed meant I was free to continue.\n\n**Me:** \"The way you and Ashley went at each other over the phone last time really made me want to tell you how tough this has been on her, and ask you to try to get along. She did not do all of this lightly. I am not sure how much you guys talk anymore outside of when we all get together at the holidays and stuff. So I want to make sure you know how smart and mature she is, and that this isn't something we rushed into. I realize that she flew off the handle a bit when we were on the phone last. But so did you. Ashley only gets like that about a couple things, and they are all related to our... situation here. I am asking you to please try to just hear us out, especially her, before you start with any insults or stuff like last time. She is really sensitive about this and I don't want there to be a scene because you two are at each other's throats. I'm really hoping you want to actually listen to us and not just scold us. Please tell me now if that's what we're walking into.\"\n\nShe didn't interrupt me, she let me just keep rambling. I got dead air for 30 seconds or so after I stopped talking. I had her on bluetooth through my car, so the sound was really clear. I could hear her take a long drag off her cigarette and exhale it out forcefully, mostly against the mic on her phone, requiring me to turn the volume down so she didn't blow my speakers out.\n\n**Sarah:** \"She know you called me?\"\n\n**Me:** \"Yup.\"\n\n**Sarah:** \"Ok, well I'll see you when you get here. Text me when you're a couple hours away.\"\n\n**Me:** \"Really? No reply to what I said?\"\n\n**Sarah:** \"I heard it all. I can't promise anything.\"\n\n**Me:** \"...Fair enough. See you soon.\"\n\nWe said bye and hung up. Not exactly what I was hoping for, but at least it was on her mind. That's all I could hope for going into something like that.\n\nI picked up Ashley at my Mom's. My Mom wasn't home so Ashley just ran out and jumped into the car and we were on our way. I noticed she was dressed really conservatively for her. Once we were on the highway, and away from the prying eyes of our hometown, Ashley leaned across the center console to give me a kiss. She told me how much she had missed me over the last week and how she couldn't wait to move in with me in a couple months. I told her I couldn't wait either, but reminded her that we needed to focus. She got back into her seat and opened up her purse. From it she pulled a few things out, one of which I recognized as her diary she had shown me that night several months ago when we first talked about her feelings for me.\n\n**Me:** \"Your diary?\"\n\n**Ashley:** \"Yeah, don't think I'm taking this lightly. I've been going over what I was going to say to her since that phone call. I know exactly what I'm going to say and how I'm going to say it.\"\n\n**Me:** \"Well I talked to her and I told her she needs to hear us out before she starts with the insults and stuff this time. Hopefully she listened to me.\"\n\n**Ashley:** \"I hope so too. But I promise that I won't say anything nasty. I'll try not to react if she does.\"\n\n**Me:** \"We need her on our side, Ash. I don't think she'd do something to really hurt us, but Sarah is kind of an enigma since she moved out all those years ago. She barely reacted to what I said to her, asking if she'd hear us out before she started in on us.\"\n\n**Ashley:** \"Yeah...\"\n\nI texted Sarah and let her know we were on time. The rest of the ride we chatted normally, occasionally coming back to Sarah, but mostly we talked about moving in together and what we had been up to. It was a nice distraction from the coming tough conversation we were about to have.\n\nWe showed up at the diner and Sarah wasn't there yet. We asked for a booth in the back, away from the few others who were in there at the time, and sat down. Thankfully it seemed pretty slow for lunchtime. We ordered some drinks and let the waitress know that we'd order food once Sarah arrived. After a little while Sarah came in. It wasn't exactly a happy meeting, but I still got up and gave her a hug when she arrived and she reciprocated. Ashley followed suit although they seemed even more stiff with each other. I sat down on one side of the booth with Ashley and Sarah sat down across from us on the other.\n\nThe waitress came over and took our orders for food. Sarah asked Ashley how Mom was and we had a semi-normal conversation for a while, avoiding the real reason we were all there that day.\n\nEventually we'd exhausted all the small talk and all kinda sat there for a minute not really knowing how to begin such an awkward conversation. After a while I started because the silence was killing me.\n\n**Me:** \"Yeah... so I guess I'll break the ice...\"\n\n**Sarah:** \"How did I know you'd start? I'm hoing she's capable of speaking as well.\"\n\nI sat back in my seat. This was going to be a long day, I could already tell. I looked at Ashley and she was staring at Sarah, barely blinking.\n\n**Sarah:** *Turning toward Ashley* \"He already called me and told me to go easy on you. But I know that you probably instigated this since you've been ogling him for years. And I also know that all men want is a piece of ass, so I'm sure once you finally managed to tell him he jumped all over it. Which, despite being fucked, I might not have even said anything about if it weren't for the fact that I know you two are moving in together now. How far exactly are you going to take this? How long has this shit-show been going on between you two?\"\n\nSarah was thankfully keeping her voice down despite her negative tone at that point, which I was happy about. There was nobody around us but I still hoped we'd all keep it low volume and civil. Ashley took a deep breath, and put her hand on my leg under the table. I could tell the \"shit-show\" comment already had her holding back. She gave my leg a little squeeze before answering.\n\n**Ashley:** \"The only thing I did for years was know that I loved him. And this isn't a 'shit-show', Sarah.\"\n\n**Sarah:** \"Oh please. Don't think I'm stupid. I literally watched you do more than just fantasize, like watching him in the shower and other weird shit when we were younger. I watched you eye him constantly. It freaked me out back then, but now I wish I had called you out.\"\n\n**Ashley:** \"You watched me watch him? What the hell Sarah?\"\n\nI laughed, which stopped the conversation for a second as they both looked at me.\n\n**Me:** *looking at Ashley* \"You watched me in the shower?\"\n\n**Ashley:** \"... yeah a couple times when you'd leave the door unlocked. It was a long time ago!\"\n\n**Me:** \"Hahaha fantastic.\" *whispering* \"Really hoping it wasn't one of the times I jerked off.\"\n\nAshley laughed, but Sarah did not look amused.\n\n**Sarah:** \"Are you not taking this seriously? Because I am trying to figure out if I need to be worried about you two ruining my life. This isn't a joke.\"\n\n**Ashley:** \"We aren't going to ruin your life. Just calm down.\"\n\n**Sarah:** \"Oh fuck off.\"\n\nAshley squeezed my leg again. I looked at her and she was staring at Sarah, not blinking. I was praying that she didn't lose it on her in public. Her reaction was calm and tempered though.\n\n**Ashley:** \"We are only here because we want to make sure that YOU aren't going to ruin OUR lives, and nuke our relationship, by telling someone else. We are perfectly happy and in love. I'm sorry if you don't understand this, but we are trying our best to make this work. You finding out was an accident, and exactly the reason I want to move out of Mom's with him.\"\n\n**Sarah:** \"You are a little girl who doesn't understand anything! You have no idea what you are doing! Have you even thought about what would happen if someone other than I found out?! You aren't in love, neither of you is. Fucking your sibling may be convenient but it is fucked up!\"\n\nSarah brought the volume level up a lot, and it freaked me out. I reacted immediately and interrupted the two of them.\n\n**Me:** \"Hey! Keep it down. Why the hell are you raising your voice? And who are you to talk to her like that and tell us how we feel?\"\n\n**Sarah:** \"Someone with way more experience than you two retards!\"\n\nSarah had been hostile the whole time, and I was sick of it already. And her raising her voice was starting to put me on edge being out in public. I lost my cool a little bit and said something that I knew she wouldn't like. Not my finest moment, but hey... I'm human.\n\n**Me:** \"Yeah, all that great experience you have cheating on (names of her last couple boyfriends I knew about, including the father of her kid) and going out and (doing drugs and stuff... I can't go into detail so I'll just leave it at fucked up shit to do with an infant at home).\"\n\nSarah immediately stood up and slapped me across the face. Hard. I stood up as soon as it happened out of shock, but that's all I could do. It happened so fast that I couldn't really react. Sarah stormed out of the diner. I sat back down and just kinda folded my hands together and looked at Ash. Her mouth was open and she had a hand on her face, holding the same spot that was stinging on mine, like she had just been smacked too. I sat there stunned for a moment.\n\n**Ashley:** \"... Are you ok?\"\n\n**Me:** \"... I guess I deserved that... but even if her fucked up experience had some kind of relation here, the name calling shit is ridiculous.\"\n\n**Ashley:** \"You probably shouldn't have said that though.\"\n\n**Me:** \"... I can't believe she slapped me. That's the first time I've ever been slapped I think... even Mom has never hit me.\"\n\n**Ashley:** \"Well you have never said something like that to Mom before.\"\n\n**Me:** \"Yeah... Nothing we were saying mattered though. And she was starting to get loud and hostile. I don't think we can do this here even if she comes back.\"\n\n**Ashley:** \"If she comes back. But you're probably right.\"\n\n**Me:** \"Let me go see if she is still here and try to smooth things over. Stay here, someone has to be here when the waitress comes back.\"\n\nAshley nodded and I got up and walked through the diner to the parking lot. I looked around and didn't see Sarah anywhere. I could feel the side of my face radiating and throbbing in the sun. She really whacked me good. I was just hoping I didn't have a mark that would draw attention to us even more. I walked around the side of the diner and finally saw her car parked near a tree in the shade. I walked closer and saw that Sarah was inside. I knocked on the passenger window and at first she didn't respond. I finally saw her face and I realized that she was crying. My comment must have really hit home. Part of me felt like a jerk, but she needed that reality check in my opinion. Outcome be damned.\n\nShe gave me a death stare when she first looked up at me. I tried to open the door but it was locked. I talked through the closed window at her.\n\n**Me:** \"Sarah, I'm sorry I said that. Will you please open the door and talk to me?\"\n\nShe continued staring at me for a minute. I repeated my request a couple times, apologizing again. She finally hit the unlock button on her side and let me in. I sat down, leaving the door open in case she decided I deserved some more slaps and I needed to make a hasty retreat.\n\n**Sarah:** \"You're a real piece of shit, you know that?\"\n\n**Me:** \"I'm sorry I said that, but I lost my cool because you were being so hostile in there and saying some hurtful stuff. Fire with fire? You aren't even giving us a chance.\"\n\n**Sarah:** \"You know right where to stick the knife in me, don't you?\"\n\n**Me:** \"Well, yeah... I was around for all of that. Ashley probably doesn't remember a good portion of it.\"\n\n**Sarah:** \"Ashley is a child who doesn't know what she is doing. Like I was when I made all those mistakes. But you're old enough to know what you are doing is wrong and stupid and can only end poorly. And it can end poorly not just for you but for Mom and me too.\"\n\n**Me:** \"First of all, Ashley is a decent amount older than you were when you started fucking up. And this is a lot different than that, be real here. And regardless, that is why we are trying to be careful and take things slow. We are being smart about stuff and trying to-\"\n\n**Sarah:** \"Smart like fucking your sister in your mother's house?!\"\n\nShe yelled that at me. I closed the door in a scramble.\n\n**Me:** \"Ok, see? That right there. YOU are the one who is being irresponsible right now! Come on Sarah. Yelling that shit in public is stupid!\"\n\n**Sarah:** \"... I'm sorry. But I'm not sure how else to react! I feel like this is partially my fault. I saw her looking at you for all those years. I knew what she was thinking, I read her diary. I saw her sneaking glances at you. But I never said anything. And now this happened. I could have put a stop to it if I had crushed her stupid little fantasy back then!\"\n\n**Me:** \"First of all, this is nobody's 'fault'. Second, I am glad that you didn't. I know this may be hard for you to understand, but we really love each other. Not just because we're family. You know that is how she has felt about me for years. And after she finally communicated that to me, it didn't take me long to fall in love with her too.\"\n\n**Sarah:** \"Bullshit. There is no way that you just somehow fell in love with your sister that quickly. I would bet anything you just wanted a piece of ass once she showed you a little skin. But it's so much more fucked up to be leading her on by playing into her fantasy, (my name)!\"\n\n**Me:** \"... Jesus fucking Christ you must have a low opinion of me. You seriously think I'd be like that? With her of all people? I'm not sure how to get this through to you. So I will just explain it from the beginning. Then you can draw whatever conclusion you want. But you don't have all the information right now. I have no reason to lie to you, because you already know enough to ruin us.\"\n\n**Sarah:** \"Oh, please enlighten me Obi-Wan!\"\n\nDespite how much the 'Obi-Wan' line was dripping in sarcasm and meant to piss me off, I couldn't help but chuckle. Sarah used to be a very happy, very awesome person to be around. Being sarcastic to each other was something we always did back in the day, before she did stupid shit, moved out, and got so damn negative and pessimistic.\n\nI proceeded to tell her everything, more or less, from the beginning. The whole process of me finding out about Ashley's feelings (I left the bit about the shower out), the details about our talks and my personal struggle with Ashley's feelings for me, and then with my own developing feelings for her. I told her about how I was the one who tried to slow things down, and how I made sure that we haven't moved too fast and that we were being really careful about everything. I told her the reasons for wanting to move in together so far away, and explained to her that the morning she had heard us was literally the second time in our relationship we had sex, the first before only about 10 hours before that. And I tried my hardest to convey that my feelings for her were real, not some convoluted plot to just bang my sister. She let me talk for a solid 10 minutes, not interrupting me once.\n\n**Sarah:** \"Ok, so I'll say it again. How was fucking in your Mom's house smart?\"\n\n**Me:** \"Because Mom was out, and wasn't going to be home for a while. We'd have heard her come home in the event that she came home early.\"\n\n**Sarah:** \"Like you heard me come home?\"\n\n**Me:** \"Mom wouldn't have parked on the street, snuck in the night before, and then listened outside the door to one of her kids fucking! And regardless, this is exactly why we want to move out. We are TRYING to have as normal of a relationship as possible, but it can't happen in our home town living with our Mom, constantly looking over our shoulders!\"\n\n**Sarah:** \"I just still don't understand why you are taking it this far...\"\n\n**Me:** \"Sarah, I can't spell it out for you any simpler. I LOVE her. I am in love with her. I know how fucked that probably sounds to you, believe me. I was so torn at first. We both were. But this happened. I couldn't get her out of my head now if I tried, and I don't want to try! I feel something for her that I have not felt with other girls. It came on like a tsunami all at once, but even after that initial wave I still feel it. It's been MONTHS now. This isn't some stupid 'whim'!\"\n\nI paused for a second, realizing that Ashley had yelled a similar thing at me when I was still questioning her feelings for me.\n\n**Me:** \"... Ashley said something like that to me when I was still denying her feelings, and mine for her. And it couldn't be more appropriate. We didn't start off fucking. We started off talking deeply about how scared we were and the ramifications of our actions if things went wrong. We kissed, went to the movies, and hung on the couch watching bullshit at home when nobody else was around, trying to learn how to navigate how we felt for each other with years of being brother and sister in the way. I know this is insane. I know there is risk. But I also know that we're happy and feel the same way about each other!\"\n\n**Sarah:** \"... I don't know what to think when you say that. And even if I did, I still think it's wrong.\"\n\n**Me:** \"Sarah, you know... I honestly thought, even early on, that if we were ever going to eventually tell anyone that it would be you.\"\n\nSarah furrowed her brow after I said that.\n\n**Sarah:** \"Why the hell would you think that?\"\n\n**Me:** \"Because I figured you'd at least understand a little bit what it was like to feel something for someone that was outside of the norm a little, and then have it questioned by people you care about.\"\n\n**Sarah:** \"... That's really not...\"\n\nShe stopped talking for a minute and just put her hands on the steering wheel, staring out the front of the car. Without looking at me, she started talking again.\n\n**Sarah:** \"That's really not the same thing...\"\n\n**Me:** \"I'm not saying the situation is identical. But I figured the feeling of having people you care about question your love or your feelings was.\"\n\nShe gripped the steering wheel a little harder and wrenched her hands around it, making a creaking noise as they slid tightly over the leather. I could see she was getting a little emotional, but she fought it off. She turned to me with an awkward look on her face.\n\n**Sarah:** \"That's not fair to compare, you know?\"\n\n**Me:** \"I could say the same thing about you and how you've been acting towards us this whole time. I know you don't understand how or why we feel this way about each other. But we do. I love her so much, Sarah. I can't just stop because you tell me it's wrong. I told MYSELF it is wrong, but here I sit, my heart beating out of my chest just to defend it!\"\n\nShe looked back out the front of the car.\n\n**Sarah:** \"... I'm sorry I hit you. I shouldn't have done that.\"\n\n**Me:** \"I'm sorry too, I shouldn't have said what I said.\"\n\n**Sarah:** \"You were right about me though... I was a mess back then. But this is much more insane than anything I was doing... minus the (drugs and stuff)... maybe.\"\n\n**Me:** \"Uh, definitely. But you may be right about this being insane. We've discussed that plenty. And we have still committed to trying to make this work and to each other. We are going forward. The only real reason we are here today is to make sure you aren't going to do anything to sabotage it.\"\n\n**Sarah:** \"I really don't know what I'm thinking now... To be honest, despite what I told you on the phone last time, I actually WAS thinking about telling Mom at first, but... you're both over 18, and I'm not sure what that would do other than give her more shit to deal with. The last thing Mom needs is all of this on her mind.\"\n\nThe thought of her telling my Mom was terrifying enough that I got a nice pit in my stomach, so I just sat quietly and didn't say anything after she said that. After another minute I got a text from Ashley that just said \"?\". I replied back \"Talking...\" and she said, \"Should I get the food to go?\". I replied \"Yes\" and told her to pay as well and come outside.\n\n**Sarah:** \"Ashley?\"\n\n**Me:** \"Yeah...\"\n\n**Sarah:** \"I need some time to think about this. Not sure what you want to do... You could come stay at my place if you want and we can talk in the morning I guess. If you want to drive the rest of the way that is.\"\n\n**Me:** \"No, I don't really want to put you out and I don't think talking at your place is much better than here if (her girlfriend) and the kids are going to be there. I'm assuming you haven't told any of this to (her girlfriend)?\"\n\n**Sarah:** \"Hell no. Nobody.\"\n\n**Me:** \"Ok... well then how about we get a hotel nearby here and stay the night? We can talk in the morning. At least it will be more private than this or your house.\"\n\n**Sarah:** \"Fine, but I'm going to just drive home. Let me know where you end up and I'll come back in the morning.\"\n\n**Me:** \"Ok... I'll text you later.\"\n\nI got out of the car and walked around to the driver side. Sarah got out and gave me a quick hug and told me to tell Ashley \"goodbye\" for her before driving off.\n\nAshley came out balancing a stack of to-go boxes shortly afterwards and we got into my car. I told her what had happened and what the plan was, and she was fine with it. She texted my Mom and let her know we wouldn't be home and would be back on Sunday. By that time my face was really starting to get sore, and the teeth on the left side of my mouth really didn't feel right at all. I had a wicked headache coming on too. Sarah had hit me way harder than even I thought she did. I poked at my teeth a little bit in the rear-view mirror, making sure she hadn't knocked any out.\n\nWe drove another half hour or so toward Sarah's before finding a cheap hotel. We checked in and made our way up to the room. I crashed down onto the bed after taking a few pain killers we'd stopped and picked up on the way. Ashley asked if I was ok, and I told her I had a wicked headache and the whole left side of my face was hurting. I pulled my phone out and turned the front camera on and checked my face out more. It was definitely a little swollen around my jaw and cheek, and crazy tender. Ashley said she'd be right back and left the room for a minute. I reached into my mouth and grabbed at my teeth, making sure again that none were loose. It felt like I had gotten punched, not slapped.\n\nAshley came back with a bucket of ice and a couple extra towels. She wet one of the smaller towels, dumped some ice in it, and tied it up before getting on the bed. She got up next to me and put the sack of ice on my face.\n\n**Me:** \"Oh my god that feels good.\"\n\nI brought my hand up and took over holding it against my jaw.\n\n**Ashley:** \"I bet. You look like hell right now.\"\n\n**Me:** \"Haha, thanks a lot.\"\n\n**Ashley:** \"Do you need anything else?\"\n\n**Me:** \"I need it to be December.\"\n\nDecember is when she would hopefully be moving in with me at our new place. Ashley smiled at me. Without another word she kissed me softly on my good cheek. I turned my head to kiss her on the lips, while still holding the ice to my face on the other side. I swear, I'd get slapped another thousand times if I could keep kissing her.\n\nKissing quickly devolved into making out, and I let the ice fall onto the bed next to me. Ashley stopped after a moment and sat up. She reached over and grabbed the towel full of ice and placed it back on my face, grabbing my hand and bringing it up to have me hold it again. She smiled at me and turned herself a bit as she started unbuttoning my pants. I didn't protest at all.\n\nShe slid my pants off and pulled me out of my boxers as well. She shifted her body so she was facing the end of the bed before flipping her hair to one side as she started giving me head. Maybe it was because my face was still throbbing in pain, but it felt extra good. My mind immediately wandered from thinking about how much my head hurt to how great she felt. She had on tight jeans and a couple layers of shirts, so I couldn't get my free hand on much, so all I did was just place it on her back as she continued.\n\nAfter a while she jumped off the end of the bed and started stripping herself down as I watched. We didn't say anything to each other, I just watched as she shyly took off each layer of clothing she had on very deliberately, staring back at me with a wiry smile as if to communicate that she hadn't planned on anything like this going down that day. And I'm sure she hadn't, since if things had gone as planned we'd have been back at our Mom's for the night and there would have been no sex happening there.\n\nShe got down to her panties and I noticed they weren't her usual thong or sexy ass-huggers, but just a very plain, pink, laundry-day style. They were cute in their own regard, but it was kind of unexpected. As she pulled those off, I saw that she was a little stubbly, her usual complete smoothness and perfectly manicured landing strip having filled in a little from not getting a waxing or shaving in a while. But I didn't give a shit. She was still beautiful and it was nice to see that she wasn't always the picturesque version of herself that she's presented to me whenever we'd fooled around previously.\n\nAsh climbed up on top of me and didn't wait long before slipping me inside her. She got her feet up so she was crouching over me and began riding me, slowly at first but picking up the pace until she had a nice rhythm going, almost bottoming out against me before lifting herself back up and repeating. She was still very tight, but it was more manageable than the last couple times as I could tell it wasn't uncomfortable for her anymore. She had her eyes closed at first as she rode me, slowly moving her hands across her stomach and up to cup her tits. I just let her do her thing, enjoying the sights and sounds of her grinding into me and getting off against her will. I know she wanted to be taking care of me in that moment but, especially in that position, I had enough stamina to outlast her. She opened her eyes and smiled at me a little, as she let out some moans and dropped her hands onto my chest before squeaking out a shaking orgasm. She cutely tried to stay upright and keep going, but I sat up and wrapped my arms around her and flipped us over, leaving the ice behind on the bed beside us. I threw her legs over my shoulders and proceeded to keep going, and for the first time she got really loud and frisky, giving me a look like she didn't know how to handle what was coming. I bent down and kissed her and it wasn't long before she came again, her hands flying around and slapping my back a couple times (which was fine because usually she'd just smack herself, I swear one of these times she is going to hurt herself lol).\n\nI stopped, still inside her, and waited to see if she was going to recover. After a few moments she opened her eyes and gave me a look like she was pissed. She pushed me off her to one side and dragged herself up, before grabbing my dick and shoving it into her mouth. She proceeded to give me possibly the best head of my life before I came and she fell back against the bed next to me.\nWe both were laying there for a second breathing heavily until she jumped up and grabbed a water we had bought and took a big gulp. Before I could make a smart ass comment about how she didn't need to swallow every time, she grabbed the towel with the ice in it off the bed and went to the bathroom. She rung the towel out, as some of the ice had melted by then, and filled it back up with fresh ice and tied it back off. She came back over to the bed and placed it back on my face, holding it there herself for a while as she kissed me a few times. Eventually I grabbed it and held it myself and she got up to put her panties and bra back on.\n\n**Me:** \"Thanks, babe.\"\n\n**Ashley:** *Giggled* \"'Babe'?\"\n\n**Me:** \"Yeah... is that weird for me to say?\"\n\n**Ashley:** \"No... that just makes it feel even more real, all of this, when you say stuff like that.\"\n\n**Me:** \"Good. Cause I love you.\"\n\nShe jumped onto the bed, half dressed, and curled up next to me.\n\n**Ashley:** \"I love you too... think we are gonna be ok?\"\n\n**Me:** \"I hope so, but we'll figure it out either way.\"\n\nI texted Sarah the address of where we were staying, and she said she'd give us a call and be by in the morning. The rest of the night was mostly uneventful. We just hung in the hotel eating the leftovers from lunch and watched TV before going to bed.\n\nI woke up the next morning to the phone ringing. It was Sarah, and she was already on her way over. We both scrambled to get up, take quick showers, and get decent. The swelling on my face had gone down a bit, but my jaw was definitely still sore.\n\nSarah arrived and she sat across from us on the other bed in the room (yes, Sarah was on the bed that we DID NOT have sex on lol).\n\n**Sarah:** \"... Your face ok?\"\n\n**Me:** \"Yeah. How about yours?\"\n\n**Sarah:** *smiled* \"I'm not falling for that one.\"\n\n**Me:** \"Well you seem to be in a better mood.\"\n\n**Sarah:** \"I had the night to think about what you said to me. I just want to ask Ashley a few things.\"\n\n**Ashley:** \"Ask away.\"\n\n**Sarah:** \"... You're sure this is what you really want? You know there are like... a million guys out there, right? And girls? You really want to commit to your BROTHER?\"\n\n**Ashley:** \"I've dated other guys. It just makes me feel shitty because they aren't him. There is no way I could be with anyone else. Especially not until we gave this a real try. And right now, it's not looking so hot for all the 'other guys'.\"\n\nAshley flashed me a quick grin before turning back to Sarah. The reassurance wasn't necessary, but it made me feel good none-the-less.\n\n**Sarah:** \"Ok... So you realize that you can't do the same stuff... like, there are certain things that can never happen with him.\"\n\n**Ashley:** \"... If you mean what I think you mean, I'm on birth control. And marriage is only something the version of me who wrote THIS thought was a real possibility.\"\n\nAshley picked up her diary from beside her and shook it in a side to side motion in front of her as she continued.\n\n**Ashley:** \"The girl who wrote this is not who I am now. I've had a long time to think about my feelings and come to terms with what they mean. I'm not the little girl who wrote this that you may still think I am. I need you to understand that I love him, and it's stronger than anything I could have ever felt when I was still writing in this thing. It's stronger than anything you saw me struggling with back when you were still living at home.\"\n\nSarah sat quiet for a minute before folding her arms and sighing.\n\n**Sarah:** \"Well... I'm not really ok with all of this, but I decided I'm not going to say anything to anyone or keep harping on your guys about all this... However, I'm also not going to cover for you or anything like that if someone like Mom finds out about you two. If you guys fuck up and Mom or someone else finds out, and they confront me, I'm going to tell them I had no idea and that they can do whatever they want. Got it? I'm not going to get sucked into having to make shit up or play spy for you.\"\n\n**Me:** \"That's more than fair, and all we'd ever ask anyway.\"\n\n**Sarah:** *Looking at me* \"And you... first of all, if you do anything fucked up to her, I'll come kick your ass.\"\n\nI chuckled a little bit, but Sarah got a very serious look on her face.\n\n**Sarah:** \"I'm serious, (my name). You're still her big brother. I'm not going to be around to remind you every day, so... you better protect her no matter what. I hope you know what I mean. I'm going to hold you responsible if anything shitty happens.\"\n\n**Me:** \"Of course.\"\n\nI actually wasn't 100% sure what she meant at the time, but it didn't matter. I had no intention of doing anything stupid or shitty. Once we were moved in together away from our home town, the only thing I knew I needed to make sure we never did was get TOO comfortable outside the confines of our place, in public. Other than that I saw no issue since I'd never hurt her myself.\n\n**Sarah:** \"Ok then... how about we go to breakfast? (Her girlfriend) and the kids are actually down in the car right now. I figured we could all go out. It'd be weird to meet up with you twice so close to home and not have them see you too, so... let's go.\"\n\nI was surprised that Sarah was acting way more understanding about things after only one night. I assumed our talk after she smacked me, combined with a night to let it all stew, helped her understand that we weren't going to give up so easily. I was skeptical that she actually understood our feelings for each other, but that wasn't required at all in my opinion. We went and checked out of the hotel quickly, grabbed our things, and headed outside. Ash and I said hi to Sarah's girlfriend and the kids, and we followed them to a nearby restaurant and had a mostly uneventful breakfast. Afterwards we said our goodbyes and headed out. I was really expecting a much longer conversation that day, but it was actually kinda anti-climactic in the end. Which I guess that was the best possible outcome me and Ash could have hoped for. We talked about our good luck on the way back and how things could have gone way worse than they did. I was glad I played to Sarah's heart-strings a little bit the day before, which was a suggestion I got on here actually. I feel like that was the real difference maker. It gave me the opportunity to really open up to her and finally give her the whole story. I think that helped to make things more clear to Sarah, rather than letting her own negative outlook on things cloud her reaction to me and Ashley being together.\n\nA couple days ago, when I was writing some of this and got around to thinking about everything that was said again, I reached out to Sarah because I wanted to know what she really meant by what she said, the \"You better protect her no matter what. I hope you know what I mean. I'm going to hold you responsible if anything shitty happens\" part. She told me in no uncertain terms that if the worst ever happened, i.e. someone found out and anything happened on the legal side with regards to me and Ashley's relationship, she'd expect me to take full responsibility and try to absolve Ashley from any fault or repercussions. I said that I wasn't sure that would be possible because we were both consenting adults, and that Ashley would most likely never let me do that regardless, but I still agreed anyway. At least in principle.\n\nAnd that is where things ended up. I will be seeing Ashley and Sarah together again for Thanksgiving (I'm sure I'll see Ash a couple times in between then, but it would be at my Mom's and we both agreed to cool our jets until she moves in with me). So the next update I will try to post will be sometime after Ashley moves in with me and we finally get a taste of what it is like living on our own and having some real privacy. Which means I probably won't be posting until sometime in late December or maybe even after that. But I will promise to post at least one follow-up after she moves in with me, if only to give some kind of closure to this roller-coaster for everyone who has helped me through this for the last few months! Thanks again to everyone who helped me to this point, and I look forward to reading your comments and replying to any questions you have between now and when she moves in! Laters!\n\nEdit: Typos and Grammar.",

It&amp;#39;s been about a week or so since all this happened now and I&amp;#39;ve had a good amount of time to digest it and discuss everything with Ashley and Sarah a little more. So it&amp;#39;s probably better it took this long anyway! Regardless, sorry for this being later than I intended! I know I told a few people I&amp;#39;d try to have it up within a few days of meeting with Sarah, so that&amp;#39;s my bad.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Diving right in, last Saturday was a long day. I didn&amp;#39;t know what to expect really going into it, but it turned into a drama-filled conversation that we wound up not being able to complete in one sitting. Sunday got nuked as well because I still had to go back to my Mom&amp;#39;s, after finishing this discussion up, to drop off Ashley and pickup the rest of my stuff along with a few things that my Mom had bought for us to put in the new place. My weekend got torpedoed pretty quickly!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll begin with a disclaimer of sorts about Sarah: she will always be my big sister, so I will always support her in the end no matter what because we are family. But she has a lot of shitty views that stem from her own negative experiences in life. There was a lot of other excess baggage surrounding her getting pregnant and having a kid really young. The details are necessary, but they effected her view of love, relationships, and men particularly, in a very negative way. Her views on stuff like that have become very pessimistic. Because of that, combined with the added mountain of a relationship between Ashley and I to climb, her attitude wound up making this conversation more difficult than it needed to be, especially at first.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I left my new place in the morning and started the long drive back home to pick up Ashley. The plan was to meet Sarah at a little out-of-the-way diner that we&amp;#39;ve gone to before about halfway to her place (~2 hours from my Mom&amp;#39;s). I hoped that the public setting would keep everyone&amp;#39;s emotions in check. In reality we should have just started at Sarah&amp;#39;s house or somewhere else more private even though it was farther. More on that later though.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On the ride, before I picked up Ashley, I called Sarah. I decided it would be a good idea to have a quick chat with Sarah before we arrived, and before her and Ashley were together in the same room together, based on the last phone call. And yes, I told Ashley I would be doing that. Sarah answered quickly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sarah:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;Hey.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;Hey. So I am on my way. I should be there a little after noon.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sarah:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;Ok. We are going to (diner name) right?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;Yeah. I called and asked them to reserve us a table for lunch, not that we should need it.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sarah:&lt;/strong&gt; K.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Her voice was flat. I couldn&amp;#39;t really gauge what she was thinking or feeling. She was fun when we were younger but as she got older, and her life got more complicated, it&amp;#39;s gotten less and less common for that side of her to come out. She is a smoker, so I heard her light up a cigarette on the other end, which meant she was outside (she doesn&amp;#39;t smoke indoors because of the kids) away from her girlfriend and kids.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;I didn&amp;#39;t just call to tell you I was on my way. I was hoping we could talk quick about a few things before we get there.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sarah just made a grunting noise like &amp;quot;Hmph&amp;quot;, which I assumed meant I was free to continue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;The way you and Ashley went at each other over the phone last time really made me want to tell you how tough this has been on her, and ask you to try to get along. She did not do all of this lightly. I am not sure how much you guys talk anymore outside of when we all get together at the holidays and stuff. So I want to make sure you know how smart and mature she is, and that this isn&amp;#39;t something we rushed into. I realize that she flew off the handle a bit when we were on the phone last. But so did you. Ashley only gets like that about a couple things, and they are all related to our... situation here. I am asking you to please try to just hear us out, especially her, before you start with any insults or stuff like last time. She is really sensitive about this and I don&amp;#39;t want there to be a scene because you two are at each other&amp;#39;s throats. I&amp;#39;m really hoping you want to actually listen to us and not just scold us. Please tell me now if that&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;re walking into.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She didn&amp;#39;t interrupt me, she let me just keep rambling. I got dead air for 30 seconds or so after I stopped talking. I had her on bluetooth through my car, so the sound was really clear. I could hear her take a long drag off her cigarette and exhale it out forcefully, mostly against the mic on her phone, requiring me to turn the volume down so she didn&amp;#39;t blow my speakers out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sarah:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;She know you called me?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;Yup.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sarah:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;Ok, well I&amp;#39;ll see you when you get here. Text me when you&amp;#39;re a couple hours away.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;Really? No reply to what I said?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sarah:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;I heard it all. I can&amp;#39;t promise anything.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;...Fair enough. See you soon.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We said bye and hung up. Not exactly what I was hoping for, but at least it was on her mind. That&amp;#39;s all I could hope for going into something like that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I picked up Ashley at my Mom&amp;#39;s. My Mom wasn&amp;#39;t home so Ashley just ran out and jumped into the car and we were on our way. I noticed she was dressed really conservatively for her. Once we were on the highway, and away from the prying eyes of our hometown, Ashley leaned across the center console to give me a kiss. She told me how much she had missed me over the last week and how she couldn&amp;#39;t wait to move in with me in a couple months. I told her I couldn&amp;#39;t wait either, but reminded her that we needed to focus. She got back into her seat and opened up her purse. From it she pulled a few things out, one of which I recognized as her diary she had shown me that night several months ago when we first talked about her feelings for me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;Your diary?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ashley:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;Yeah, don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;m taking this lightly. I&amp;#39;ve been going over what I was going to say to her since that phone call. I know exactly what I&amp;#39;m going to say and how I&amp;#39;m going to say it.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;Well I talked to her and I told her she needs to hear us out before she starts with the insults and stuff this time. Hopefully she listened to me.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ashley:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;I hope so too. But I promise that I won&amp;#39;t say anything nasty. I&amp;#39;ll try not to react if she does.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;We need her on our side, Ash. I don&amp;#39;t think she&amp;#39;d do something to really hurt us, but Sarah is kind of an enigma since she moved out all those years ago. She barely reacted to what I said to her, asking if she&amp;#39;d hear us out before she started in on us.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ashley:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;Yeah...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I texted Sarah and let her know we were on time. The rest of the ride we chatted normally, occasionally coming back to Sarah, but mostly we talked about moving in together and what we had been up to. It was a nice distraction from the coming tough conversation we were about to have.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We showed up at the diner and Sarah wasn&amp;#39;t there yet. We asked for a booth in the back, away from the few others who were in there at the time, and sat down. Thankfully it seemed pretty slow for lunchtime. We ordered some drinks and let the waitress know that we&amp;#39;d order food once Sarah arrived. After a little while Sarah came in. It wasn&amp;#39;t exactly a happy meeting, but I still got up and gave her a hug when she arrived and she reciprocated. Ashley followed suit although they seemed even more stiff with each other. I sat down on one side of the booth with Ashley and Sarah sat down across from us on the other.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The waitress came over and took our orders for food. Sarah asked Ashley how Mom was and we had a semi-normal conversation for a while, avoiding the real reason we were all there that day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Eventually we&amp;#39;d exhausted all the small talk and all kinda sat there for a minute not really knowing how to begin such an awkward conversation. After a while I started because the silence was killing me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;Yeah... so I guess I&amp;#39;ll break the ice...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sarah:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;How did I know you&amp;#39;d start? I&amp;#39;m hoing she&amp;#39;s capable of speaking as well.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I sat back in my seat. This was going to be a long day, I could already tell. I looked at Ashley and she was staring at Sarah, barely blinking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sarah:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Turning toward Ashley&lt;/em&gt; &amp;quot;He already called me and told me to go easy on you. But I know that you probably instigated this since you&amp;#39;ve been ogling him for years. And I also know that all men want is a piece of ass, so I&amp;#39;m sure once you finally managed to tell him he jumped all over it. Which, despite being fucked, I might not have even said anything about if it weren&amp;#39;t for the fact that I know you two are moving in together now. How far exactly are you going to take this? How long has this shit-show been going on between you two?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sarah was thankfully keeping her voice down despite her negative tone at that point, which I was happy about. There was nobody around us but I still hoped we&amp;#39;d all keep it low volume and civil. Ashley took a deep breath, and put her hand on my leg under the table. I could tell the &amp;quot;shit-show&amp;quot; comment already had her holding back. She gave my leg a little squeeze before answering.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ashley:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;The only thing I did for years was know that I loved him. And this isn&amp;#39;t a &amp;#39;shit-show&amp;#39;, Sarah.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sarah:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;Oh please. Don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;m stupid. I literally watched you do more than just fantasize, like watching him in the shower and other weird shit when we were younger. I watched you eye him constantly. It freaked me out back then, but now I wish I had called you out.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ashley:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;You watched me watch him? What the hell Sarah?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I laughed, which stopped the conversation for a second as they both looked at me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;looking at Ashley&lt;/em&gt; &amp;quot;You watched me in the shower?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ashley:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;... yeah a couple times when you&amp;#39;d leave the door unlocked. It was a long time ago!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;Hahaha fantastic.&amp;quot; &lt;em&gt;whispering&lt;/em&gt; &amp;quot;Really hoping it wasn&amp;#39;t one of the times I jerked off.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ashley laughed, but Sarah did not look amused.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sarah:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;Are you not taking this seriously? Because I am trying to figure out if I need to be worried about you two ruining my life. This isn&amp;#39;t a joke.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ashley:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;We aren&amp;#39;t going to ruin your life. Just calm down.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sarah:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;Oh fuck off.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ashley squeezed my leg again. I looked at her and she was staring at Sarah, not blinking. I was praying that she didn&amp;#39;t lose it on her in public. Her reaction was calm and tempered though.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ashley:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;We are only here because we want to make sure that YOU aren&amp;#39;t going to ruin OUR lives, and nuke our relationship, by telling someone else. We are perfectly happy and in love. I&amp;#39;m sorry if you don&amp;#39;t understand this, but we are trying our best to make this work. You finding out was an accident, and exactly the reason I want to move out of Mom&amp;#39;s with him.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sarah:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;You are a little girl who doesn&amp;#39;t understand anything! You have no idea what you are doing! Have you even thought about what would happen if someone other than I found out?! You aren&amp;#39;t in love, neither of you is. Fucking your sibling may be convenient but it is fucked up!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sarah brought the volume level up a lot, and it freaked me out. I reacted immediately and interrupted the two of them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;Hey! Keep it down. Why the hell are you raising your voice? And who are you to talk to her like that and tell us how we feel?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sarah:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;Someone with way more experience than you two retards!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sarah had been hostile the whole time, and I was sick of it already. And her raising her voice was starting to put me on edge being out in public. I lost my cool a little bit and said something that I knew she wouldn&amp;#39;t like. Not my finest moment, but hey... I&amp;#39;m human.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;Yeah, all that great experience you have cheating on (names of her last couple boyfriends I knew about, including the father of her kid) and going out and (doing drugs and stuff... I can&amp;#39;t go into detail so I&amp;#39;ll just leave it at fucked up shit to do with an infant at home).&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sarah immediately stood up and slapped me across the face. Hard. I stood up as soon as it happened out of shock, but that&amp;#39;s all I could do. It happened so fast that I couldn&amp;#39;t really react. Sarah stormed out of the diner. I sat back down and just kinda folded my hands together and looked at Ash. Her mouth was open and she had a hand on her face, holding the same spot that was stinging on mine, like she had just been smacked too. I sat there stunned for a moment.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ashley:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;... Are you ok?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;... I guess I deserved that... but even if her fucked up experience had some kind of relation here, the name calling shit is ridiculous.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ashley:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;You probably shouldn&amp;#39;t have said that though.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;... I can&amp;#39;t believe she slapped me. That&amp;#39;s the first time I&amp;#39;ve ever been slapped I think... even Mom has never hit me.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ashley:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;Well you have never said something like that to Mom before.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;Yeah... Nothing we were saying mattered though. And she was starting to get loud and hostile. I don&amp;#39;t think we can do this here even if she comes back.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ashley:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;If she comes back. But you&amp;#39;re probably right.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;Let me go see if she is still here and try to smooth things over. Stay here, someone has to be here when the waitress comes back.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ashley nodded and I got up and walked through the diner to the parking lot. I looked around and didn&amp;#39;t see Sarah anywhere. I could feel the side of my face radiating and throbbing in the sun. She really whacked me good. I was just hoping I didn&amp;#39;t have a mark that would draw attention to us even more. I walked around the side of the diner and finally saw her car parked near a tree in the shade. I walked closer and saw that Sarah was inside. I knocked on the passenger window and at first she didn&amp;#39;t respond. I finally saw her face and I realized that she was crying. My comment must have really hit home. Part of me felt like a jerk, but she needed that reality check in my opinion. Outcome be damned.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She gave me a death stare when she first looked up at me. I tried to open the door but it was locked. I talked through the closed window at her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;Sarah, I&amp;#39;m sorry I said that. Will you please open the door and talk to me?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She continued staring at me for a minute. I repeated my request a couple times, apologizing again. She finally hit the unlock button on her side and let me in. I sat down, leaving the door open in case she decided I deserved some more slaps and I needed to make a hasty retreat.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sarah:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re a real piece of shit, you know that?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m sorry I said that, but I lost my cool because you were being so hostile in there and saying some hurtful stuff. Fire with fire? You aren&amp;#39;t even giving us a chance.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sarah:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;You know right where to stick the knife in me, don&amp;#39;t you?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;Well, yeah... I was around for all of that. Ashley probably doesn&amp;#39;t remember a good portion of it.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sarah:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;Ashley is a child who doesn&amp;#39;t know what she is doing. Like I was when I made all those mistakes. But you&amp;#39;re old enough to know what you are doing is wrong and stupid and can only end poorly. And it can end poorly not just for you but for Mom and me too.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;First of all, Ashley is a decent amount older than you were when you started fucking up. And this is a lot different than that, be real here. And regardless, that is why we are trying to be careful and take things slow. We are being smart about stuff and trying to-&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sarah:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;Smart like fucking your sister in your mother&amp;#39;s house?!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She yelled that at me. I closed the door in a scramble.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;Ok, see? That right there. YOU are the one who is being irresponsible right now! Come on Sarah. Yelling that shit in public is stupid!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sarah:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;... I&amp;#39;m sorry. But I&amp;#39;m not sure how else to react! I feel like this is partially my fault. I saw her looking at you for all those years. I knew what she was thinking, I read her diary. I saw her sneaking glances at you. But I never said anything. And now this happened. I could have put a stop to it if I had crushed her stupid little fantasy back then!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;First of all, this is nobody&amp;#39;s &amp;#39;fault&amp;#39;. Second, I am glad that you didn&amp;#39;t. I know this may be hard for you to understand, but we really love each other. Not just because we&amp;#39;re family. You know that is how she has felt about me for years. And after she finally communicated that to me, it didn&amp;#39;t take me long to fall in love with her too.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sarah:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;Bullshit. There is no way that you just somehow fell in love with your sister that quickly. I would bet anything you just wanted a piece of ass once she showed you a little skin. But it&amp;#39;s so much more fucked up to be leading her on by playing into her fantasy, (my name)!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;... Jesus fucking Christ you must have a low opinion of me. You seriously think I&amp;#39;d be like that? With her of all people? I&amp;#39;m not sure how to get this through to you. So I will just explain it from the beginning. Then you can draw whatever conclusion you want. But you don&amp;#39;t have all the information right now. I have no reason to lie to you, because you already know enough to ruin us.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sarah:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;Oh, please enlighten me Obi-Wan!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Despite how much the &amp;#39;Obi-Wan&amp;#39; line was dripping in sarcasm and meant to piss me off, I couldn&amp;#39;t help but chuckle. Sarah used to be a very happy, very awesome person to be around. Being sarcastic to each other was something we always did back in the day, before she did stupid shit, moved out, and got so damn negative and pessimistic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I proceeded to tell her everything, more or less, from the beginning. The whole process of me finding out about Ashley&amp;#39;s feelings (I left the bit about the shower out), the details about our talks and my personal struggle with Ashley&amp;#39;s feelings for me, and then with my own developing feelings for her. I told her about how I was the one who tried to slow things down, and how I made sure that we haven&amp;#39;t moved too fast and that we were being really careful about everything. I told her the reasons for wanting to move in together so far away, and explained to her that the morning she had heard us was literally the second time in our relationship we had sex, the first before only about 10 hours before that. And I tried my hardest to convey that my feelings for her were real, not some convoluted plot to just bang my sister. She let me talk for a solid 10 minutes, not interrupting me once.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sarah:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;Ok, so I&amp;#39;ll say it again. How was fucking in your Mom&amp;#39;s house smart?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;Because Mom was out, and wasn&amp;#39;t going to be home for a while. We&amp;#39;d have heard her come home in the event that she came home early.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sarah:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;Like you heard me come home?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;Mom wouldn&amp;#39;t have parked on the street, snuck in the night before, and then listened outside the door to one of her kids fucking! And regardless, this is exactly why we want to move out. We are TRYING to have as normal of a relationship as possible, but it can&amp;#39;t happen in our home town living with our Mom, constantly looking over our shoulders!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sarah:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;I just still don&amp;#39;t understand why you are taking it this far...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;Sarah, I can&amp;#39;t spell it out for you any simpler. I LOVE her. I am in love with her. I know how fucked that probably sounds to you, believe me. I was so torn at first. We both were. But this happened. I couldn&amp;#39;t get her out of my head now if I tried, and I don&amp;#39;t want to try! I feel something for her that I have not felt with other girls. It came on like a tsunami all at once, but even after that initial wave I still feel it. It&amp;#39;s been MONTHS now. This isn&amp;#39;t some stupid &amp;#39;whim&amp;#39;!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I paused for a second, realizing that Ashley had yelled a similar thing at me when I was still questioning her feelings for me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;... Ashley said something like that to me when I was still denying her feelings, and mine for her. And it couldn&amp;#39;t be more appropriate. We didn&amp;#39;t start off fucking. We started off talking deeply about how scared we were and the ramifications of our actions if things went wrong. We kissed, went to the movies, and hung on the couch watching bullshit at home when nobody else was around, trying to learn how to navigate how we felt for each other with years of being brother and sister in the way. I know this is insane. I know there is risk. But I also know that we&amp;#39;re happy and feel the same way about each other!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sarah:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;... I don&amp;#39;t know what to think when you say that. And even if I did, I still think it&amp;#39;s wrong.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;Sarah, you know... I honestly thought, even early on, that if we were ever going to eventually tell anyone that it would be you.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sarah furrowed her brow after I said that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sarah:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;Why the hell would you think that?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;Because I figured you&amp;#39;d at least understand a little bit what it was like to feel something for someone that was outside of the norm a little, and then have it questioned by people you care about.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sarah:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;... That&amp;#39;s really not...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She stopped talking for a minute and just put her hands on the steering wheel, staring out the front of the car. Without looking at me, she started talking again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sarah:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s really not the same thing...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m not saying the situation is identical. But I figured the feeling of having people you care about question your love or your feelings was.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She gripped the steering wheel a little harder and wrenched her hands around it, making a creaking noise as they slid tightly over the leather. I could see she was getting a little emotional, but she fought it off. She turned to me with an awkward look on her face.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sarah:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s not fair to compare, you know?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;I could say the same thing about you and how you&amp;#39;ve been acting towards us this whole time. I know you don&amp;#39;t understand how or why we feel this way about each other. But we do. I love her so much, Sarah. I can&amp;#39;t just stop because you tell me it&amp;#39;s wrong. I told MYSELF it is wrong, but here I sit, my heart beating out of my chest just to defend it!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She looked back out the front of the car.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sarah:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;... I&amp;#39;m sorry I hit you. I shouldn&amp;#39;t have done that.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m sorry too, I shouldn&amp;#39;t have said what I said.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sarah:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;You were right about me though... I was a mess back then. But this is much more insane than anything I was doing... minus the (drugs and stuff)... maybe.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;Uh, definitely. But you may be right about this being insane. We&amp;#39;ve discussed that plenty. And we have still committed to trying to make this work and to each other. We are going forward. The only real reason we are here today is to make sure you aren&amp;#39;t going to do anything to sabotage it.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sarah:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;I really don&amp;#39;t know what I&amp;#39;m thinking now... To be honest, despite what I told you on the phone last time, I actually WAS thinking about telling Mom at first, but... you&amp;#39;re both over 18, and I&amp;#39;m not sure what that would do other than give her more shit to deal with. The last thing Mom needs is all of this on her mind.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The thought of her telling my Mom was terrifying enough that I got a nice pit in my stomach, so I just sat quietly and didn&amp;#39;t say anything after she said that. After another minute I got a text from Ashley that just said &amp;quot;?&amp;quot;. I replied back &amp;quot;Talking...&amp;quot; and she said, &amp;quot;Should I get the food to go?&amp;quot;. I replied &amp;quot;Yes&amp;quot; and told her to pay as well and come outside.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sarah:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;Ashley?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;Yeah...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sarah:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;I need some time to think about this. Not sure what you want to do... You could come stay at my place if you want and we can talk in the morning I guess. If you want to drive the rest of the way that is.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;No, I don&amp;#39;t really want to put you out and I don&amp;#39;t think talking at your place is much better than here if (her girlfriend) and the kids are going to be there. I&amp;#39;m assuming you haven&amp;#39;t told any of this to (her girlfriend)?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sarah:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;Hell no. Nobody.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;Ok... well then how about we get a hotel nearby here and stay the night? We can talk in the morning. At least it will be more private than this or your house.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sarah:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;Fine, but I&amp;#39;m going to just drive home. Let me know where you end up and I&amp;#39;ll come back in the morning.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;Ok... I&amp;#39;ll text you later.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got out of the car and walked around to the driver side. Sarah got out and gave me a quick hug and told me to tell Ashley &amp;quot;goodbye&amp;quot; for her before driving off.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ashley came out balancing a stack of to-go boxes shortly afterwards and we got into my car. I told her what had happened and what the plan was, and she was fine with it. She texted my Mom and let her know we wouldn&amp;#39;t be home and would be back on Sunday. By that time my face was really starting to get sore, and the teeth on the left side of my mouth really didn&amp;#39;t feel right at all. I had a wicked headache coming on too. Sarah had hit me way harder than even I thought she did. I poked at my teeth a little bit in the rear-view mirror, making sure she hadn&amp;#39;t knocked any out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We drove another half hour or so toward Sarah&amp;#39;s before finding a cheap hotel. We checked in and made our way up to the room. I crashed down onto the bed after taking a few pain killers we&amp;#39;d stopped and picked up on the way. Ashley asked if I was ok, and I told her I had a wicked headache and the whole left side of my face was hurting. I pulled my phone out and turned the front camera on and checked my face out more. It was definitely a little swollen around my jaw and cheek, and crazy tender. Ashley said she&amp;#39;d be right back and left the room for a minute. I reached into my mouth and grabbed at my teeth, making sure again that none were loose. It felt like I had gotten punched, not slapped.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ashley came back with a bucket of ice and a couple extra towels. She wet one of the smaller towels, dumped some ice in it, and tied it up before getting on the bed. She got up next to me and put the sack of ice on my face.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;Oh my god that feels good.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I brought my hand up and took over holding it against my jaw.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ashley:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;I bet. You look like hell right now.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;Haha, thanks a lot.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ashley:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;Do you need anything else?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;I need it to be December.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;December is when she would hopefully be moving in with me at our new place. Ashley smiled at me. Without another word she kissed me softly on my good cheek. I turned my head to kiss her on the lips, while still holding the ice to my face on the other side. I swear, I&amp;#39;d get slapped another thousand times if I could keep kissing her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kissing quickly devolved into making out, and I let the ice fall onto the bed next to me. Ashley stopped after a moment and sat up. She reached over and grabbed the towel full of ice and placed it back on my face, grabbing my hand and bringing it up to have me hold it again. She smiled at me and turned herself a bit as she started unbuttoning my pants. I didn&amp;#39;t protest at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She slid my pants off and pulled me out of my boxers as well. She shifted her body so she was facing the end of the bed before flipping her hair to one side as she started giving me head. Maybe it was because my face was still throbbing in pain, but it felt extra good. My mind immediately wandered from thinking about how much my head hurt to how great she felt. She had on tight jeans and a couple layers of shirts, so I couldn&amp;#39;t get my free hand on much, so all I did was just place it on her back as she continued.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After a while she jumped off the end of the bed and started stripping herself down as I watched. We didn&amp;#39;t say anything to each other, I just watched as she shyly took off each layer of clothing she had on very deliberately, staring back at me with a wiry smile as if to communicate that she hadn&amp;#39;t planned on anything like this going down that day. And I&amp;#39;m sure she hadn&amp;#39;t, since if things had gone as planned we&amp;#39;d have been back at our Mom&amp;#39;s for the night and there would have been no sex happening there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She got down to her panties and I noticed they weren&amp;#39;t her usual thong or sexy ass-huggers, but just a very plain, pink, laundry-day style. They were cute in their own regard, but it was kind of unexpected. As she pulled those off, I saw that she was a little stubbly, her usual complete smoothness and perfectly manicured landing strip having filled in a little from not getting a waxing or shaving in a while. But I didn&amp;#39;t give a shit. She was still beautiful and it was nice to see that she wasn&amp;#39;t always the picturesque version of herself that she&amp;#39;s presented to me whenever we&amp;#39;d fooled around previously.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ash climbed up on top of me and didn&amp;#39;t wait long before slipping me inside her. She got her feet up so she was crouching over me and began riding me, slowly at first but picking up the pace until she had a nice rhythm going, almost bottoming out against me before lifting herself back up and repeating. She was still very tight, but it was more manageable than the last couple times as I could tell it wasn&amp;#39;t uncomfortable for her anymore. She had her eyes closed at first as she rode me, slowly moving her hands across her stomach and up to cup her tits. I just let her do her thing, enjoying the sights and sounds of her grinding into me and getting off against her will. I know she wanted to be taking care of me in that moment but, especially in that position, I had enough stamina to outlast her. She opened her eyes and smiled at me a little, as she let out some moans and dropped her hands onto my chest before squeaking out a shaking orgasm. She cutely tried to stay upright and keep going, but I sat up and wrapped my arms around her and flipped us over, leaving the ice behind on the bed beside us. I threw her legs over my shoulders and proceeded to keep going, and for the first time she got really loud and frisky, giving me a look like she didn&amp;#39;t know how to handle what was coming. I bent down and kissed her and it wasn&amp;#39;t long before she came again, her hands flying around and slapping my back a couple times (which was fine because usually she&amp;#39;d just smack herself, I swear one of these times she is going to hurt herself lol).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I stopped, still inside her, and waited to see if she was going to recover. After a few moments she opened her eyes and gave me a look like she was pissed. She pushed me off her to one side and dragged herself up, before grabbing my dick and shoving it into her mouth. She proceeded to give me possibly the best head of my life before I came and she fell back against the bed next to me.\nWe both were laying there for a second breathing heavily until she jumped up and grabbed a water we had bought and took a big gulp. Before I could make a smart ass comment about how she didn&amp;#39;t need to swallow every time, she grabbed the towel with the ice in it off the bed and went to the bathroom. She rung the towel out, as some of the ice had melted by then, and filled it back up with fresh ice and tied it back off. She came back over to the bed and placed it back on my face, holding it there herself for a while as she kissed me a few times. Eventually I grabbed it and held it myself and she got up to put her panties and bra back on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;Thanks, babe.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ashley:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Giggled&lt;/em&gt; &amp;quot;&amp;#39;Babe&amp;#39;?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;Yeah... is that weird for me to say?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ashley:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;No... that just makes it feel even more real, all of this, when you say stuff like that.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;Good. Cause I love you.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She jumped onto the bed, half dressed, and curled up next to me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ashley:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;I love you too... think we are gonna be ok?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;I hope so, but we&amp;#39;ll figure it out either way.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I texted Sarah the address of where we were staying, and she said she&amp;#39;d give us a call and be by in the morning. The rest of the night was mostly uneventful. We just hung in the hotel eating the leftovers from lunch and watched TV before going to bed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I woke up the next morning to the phone ringing. It was Sarah, and she was already on her way over. We both scrambled to get up, take quick showers, and get decent. The swelling on my face had gone down a bit, but my jaw was definitely still sore.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sarah arrived and she sat across from us on the other bed in the room (yes, Sarah was on the bed that we DID NOT have sex on lol).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sarah:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;... Your face ok?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;Yeah. How about yours?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sarah:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;smiled&lt;/em&gt; &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m not falling for that one.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;Well you seem to be in a better mood.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sarah:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;I had the night to think about what you said to me. I just want to ask Ashley a few things.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ashley:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;Ask away.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sarah:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;... You&amp;#39;re sure this is what you really want? You know there are like... a million guys out there, right? And girls? You really want to commit to your BROTHER?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ashley:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ve dated other guys. It just makes me feel shitty because they aren&amp;#39;t him. There is no way I could be with anyone else. Especially not until we gave this a real try. And right now, it&amp;#39;s not looking so hot for all the &amp;#39;other guys&amp;#39;.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ashley flashed me a quick grin before turning back to Sarah. The reassurance wasn&amp;#39;t necessary, but it made me feel good none-the-less.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sarah:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;Ok... So you realize that you can&amp;#39;t do the same stuff... like, there are certain things that can never happen with him.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ashley:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;... If you mean what I think you mean, I&amp;#39;m on birth control. And marriage is only something the version of me who wrote THIS thought was a real possibility.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ashley picked up her diary from beside her and shook it in a side to side motion in front of her as she continued.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ashley:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;The girl who wrote this is not who I am now. I&amp;#39;ve had a long time to think about my feelings and come to terms with what they mean. I&amp;#39;m not the little girl who wrote this that you may still think I am. I need you to understand that I love him, and it&amp;#39;s stronger than anything I could have ever felt when I was still writing in this thing. It&amp;#39;s stronger than anything you saw me struggling with back when you were still living at home.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sarah sat quiet for a minute before folding her arms and sighing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sarah:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;Well... I&amp;#39;m not really ok with all of this, but I decided I&amp;#39;m not going to say anything to anyone or keep harping on your guys about all this... However, I&amp;#39;m also not going to cover for you or anything like that if someone like Mom finds out about you two. If you guys fuck up and Mom or someone else finds out, and they confront me, I&amp;#39;m going to tell them I had no idea and that they can do whatever they want. Got it? I&amp;#39;m not going to get sucked into having to make shit up or play spy for you.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s more than fair, and all we&amp;#39;d ever ask anyway.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sarah:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Looking at me&lt;/em&gt; &amp;quot;And you... first of all, if you do anything fucked up to her, I&amp;#39;ll come kick your ass.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I chuckled a little bit, but Sarah got a very serious look on her face.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sarah:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m serious, (my name). You&amp;#39;re still her big brother. I&amp;#39;m not going to be around to remind you every day, so... you better protect her no matter what. I hope you know what I mean. I&amp;#39;m going to hold you responsible if anything shitty happens.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;Of course.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I actually wasn&amp;#39;t 100% sure what she meant at the time, but it didn&amp;#39;t matter. I had no intention of doing anything stupid or shitty. Once we were moved in together away from our home town, the only thing I knew I needed to make sure we never did was get TOO comfortable outside the confines of our place, in public. Other than that I saw no issue since I&amp;#39;d never hurt her myself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sarah:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;Ok then... how about we go to breakfast? (Her girlfriend) and the kids are actually down in the car right now. I figured we could all go out. It&amp;#39;d be weird to meet up with you twice so close to home and not have them see you too, so... let&amp;#39;s go.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was surprised that Sarah was acting way more understanding about things after only one night. I assumed our talk after she smacked me, combined with a night to let it all stew, helped her understand that we weren&amp;#39;t going to give up so easily. I was skeptical that she actually understood our feelings for each other, but that wasn&amp;#39;t required at all in my opinion. We went and checked out of the hotel quickly, grabbed our things, and headed outside. Ash and I said hi to Sarah&amp;#39;s girlfriend and the kids, and we followed them to a nearby restaurant and had a mostly uneventful breakfast. Afterwards we said our goodbyes and headed out. I was really expecting a much longer conversation that day, but it was actually kinda anti-climactic in the end. Which I guess that was the best possible outcome me and Ash could have hoped for. We talked about our good luck on the way back and how things could have gone way worse than they did. I was glad I played to Sarah&amp;#39;s heart-strings a little bit the day before, which was a suggestion I got on here actually. I feel like that was the real difference maker. It gave me the opportunity to really open up to her and finally give her the whole story. I think that helped to make things more clear to Sarah, rather than letting her own negative outlook on things cloud her reaction to me and Ashley being together.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A couple days ago, when I was writing some of this and got around to thinking about everything that was said again, I reached out to Sarah because I wanted to know what she really meant by what she said, the &amp;quot;You better protect her no matter what. I hope you know what I mean. I&amp;#39;m going to hold you responsible if anything shitty happens&amp;quot; part. She told me in no uncertain terms that if the worst ever happened, i.e. someone found out and anything happened on the legal side with regards to me and Ashley&amp;#39;s relationship, she&amp;#39;d expect me to take full responsibility and try to absolve Ashley from any fault or repercussions. I said that I wasn&amp;#39;t sure that would be possible because we were both consenting adults, and that Ashley would most likely never let me do that regardless, but I still agreed anyway. At least in principle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And that is where things ended up. I will be seeing Ashley and Sarah together again for Thanksgiving (I&amp;#39;m sure I&amp;#39;ll see Ash a couple times in between then, but it would be at my Mom&amp;#39;s and we both agreed to cool our jets until she moves in with me). So the next update I will try to post will be sometime after Ashley moves in with me and we finally get a taste of what it is like living on our own and having some real privacy. Which means I probably won&amp;#39;t be posting until sometime in late December or maybe even after that. But I will promise to post at least one follow-up after she moves in with me, if only to give some kind of closure to this roller-coaster for everyone who has helped me through this for the last few months! Thanks again to everyone who helped me to this point, and I look forward to reading your comments and replying to any questions you have between now and when she moves in! Laters!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: Typos and Grammar.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Problem is I really don't know if her advice would be useful, considering how jaded and just plain angry she is (good word, jaded, definitely describes part of Sarah's personality).\n\nIf I can somehow help show Sarah that love is real and can still work out for people against all odds, that'd be icing on the cake for sure. I really don't know Sarah as well as I think I do anymore, though. This whole experience has shown me that. She's changed a lot since we were younger. Maybe things will change now that we've had that frank conversation in her car, but only time will tell.\n\nThanks for your comments and well wishes.

I'm prepared for things to be difficult, but hoping we get a break from the drama for a long time!\n\nFunny enough, we were just talking about her orgasms at the hotel. I mentioned to her how intense her second one was, and she commented on how she normally doesn't go back-to-back like she did (once previously she actually had me stop for a minute before continuing). So yes, Ashley usually does orgasm, especially when she is on the bottom, without me having to directly stimulate anything else. Fairly quickly if there has been any foreplay beforehand too.\n\nOn top, she usually touches herself a little. But it's more of an \"extra\" (her word, not mine). I don't bother describing certain details that aren't really necessary. At the end of the day I'm not trying to write an erotic novel, so I leave some of the superfluous stuff out generally. But I can get her to orgasm with just penetration usually. One of my previous girlfriends was the same way. Doggy-style was her favorite position, and she never bothered touching herself. I could just hit all the right spots.\n\nNot sure if you read earlier comments I've made, but I mentioned previously another girl I was with for only a couple of months back in college who was the complete opposite. I literally couldn't make her come. Penetration, playing with her clit, different positions, anal, toys, etc. Literally nothing worked. She was a \"starfish\" though, and didn't do anything during sex, so I really am not surprised. I always wondered if she could even get herself off. That relationship tanked fairly quickly. Only time I've encountered that.\n\nAshley and I have only done a couple positions so far, and have barely scratched the surface learning about each other in the bedroom. Hopefully we will be able to experiment more and really get to know each other even better after she moves in (I can still count on 2 hands how many times we've actually had sex so far).",

I&amp;#39;m prepared for things to be difficult, but hoping we get a break from the drama for a long time!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Funny enough, we were just talking about her orgasms at the hotel. I mentioned to her how intense her second one was, and she commented on how she normally doesn&amp;#39;t go back-to-back like she did (once previously she actually had me stop for a minute before continuing). So yes, Ashley usually does orgasm, especially when she is on the bottom, without me having to directly stimulate anything else. Fairly quickly if there has been any foreplay beforehand too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On top, she usually touches herself a little. But it&amp;#39;s more of an &amp;quot;extra&amp;quot; (her word, not mine). I don&amp;#39;t bother describing certain details that aren&amp;#39;t really necessary. At the end of the day I&amp;#39;m not trying to write an erotic novel, so I leave some of the superfluous stuff out generally. But I can get her to orgasm with just penetration usually. One of my previous girlfriends was the same way. Doggy-style was her favorite position, and she never bothered touching herself. I could just hit all the right spots.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not sure if you read earlier comments I&amp;#39;ve made, but I mentioned previously another girl I was with for only a couple of months back in college who was the complete opposite. I literally couldn&amp;#39;t make her come. Penetration, playing with her clit, different positions, anal, toys, etc. Literally nothing worked. She was a &amp;quot;starfish&amp;quot; though, and didn&amp;#39;t do anything during sex, so I really am not surprised. I always wondered if she could even get herself off. That relationship tanked fairly quickly. Only time I&amp;#39;ve encountered that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ashley and I have only done a couple positions so far, and have barely scratched the surface learning about each other in the bedroom. Hopefully we will be able to experiment more and really get to know each other even better after she moves in (I can still count on 2 hands how many times we&amp;#39;ve actually had sex so far).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

Like, she has the nuclear option, but nothing else. Her stance of \"keep me out of it and I'm not your ally in this\" is her only real move.\n\nI am sure she has some hangups about men, but I think what she meant about the \"men just want ass\" isn't that she suspects you're just going for the easy lay. I think it's more of \"young men tend to think with their dicks,\" which frankly I think you'd have a much better defense against if less of this had happened at the foot of Ashley's bed, or with her kissing you, or really if any of your feelings had been there before Ashley started pretty aggressively courting you in a sexual way. But I've said as much before.\n\nIn the future, if you find yourself in similar situations, do try to step back and let Ashley take part more. Seems like you kind of played the role of defender a lot, which I get from a I-care standpoint (I'm nodding knowingly at the \"treat women like princesses\" stuff). You said several times that she can make her own decisions and fight her own battles, but based on your depiction here, that's not what happened. This was you and Sarah 90%. And you straight up did call her ahead of time to tell her to take it easy on Ashley. Again, I get it. Just a thing to think about next time.\n\nOh boy. Man, I've said it before, but this all makes me feel like reaching through the screen and shaking you. That line where you're like \"It's been MONTHS now. This isn't some stupid 'whim'!\" is just so ironic... Like a 12 year old saying \"I'm not a kid anymore!\" Like, I don't want to keep bringing up your age, but it's this naive shit that makes me think this is like a high school romance. Like this is your first time actually feeling like you're in love, and your feelings are special and nobody else understands.\n\nIn any event, I'm glad everyone is safe. Again, I don't have any misconceptions that I'll change your mind about anything, but I hope that in the long run some dissenting voices will do you some good. Good luck man.",
