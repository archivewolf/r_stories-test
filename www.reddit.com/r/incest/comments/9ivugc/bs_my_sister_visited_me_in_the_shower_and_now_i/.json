GET COMFY!* **\n\n[Original Post](https://old.reddit.com/r/incest/comments/953zdw/bs_my_sister_visited_me_in_the_shower_and_now_i/)\n\n[Update 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/incest/comments/97lq05/bs_my_sister_visited_me_in_the_shower_and_now_i/)\n\n[Update 2](https://old.reddit.com/r/incest/comments/9bcdj4/bs_my_sister_visited_me_in_the_shower_and_now_i/)\n\nIt has been about a month since I last posted. A lot has happened. Some good, some bad, some crazy. Honestly I didn't expect to be back here posting so soon. I have a lot to get through first before I can get to the reason I'm really here, so I'll dive right in.\n\nGood news first: I officially graduated from college (technically I already had but I got my diploma finally). There was a smaller ceremony for those who graduated over the summer, and my mom got to take pictures of me in my robe, so everything worked out. Once I had my diploma in hand things started moving quickly, as most job offers I had received already were just waiting on a copy of my diploma to finalize things. I began the process of deciding where I wanted to go, keeping in mind my relationship with Ashley the whole time.\n\nThe last 4 weeks have been a learning curve for me and Ashley. The good times have been really good, but living at home and trying to hide a relationship with your sister is exhausting. Even with a Mom who is out of the house a lot it's rough. We have been growing more intimate with each other as time has gone by, exploring each other and our relationship more. That has been the easiest part for us. What we've found is that it is tough to do things as a couple outside of the house. Behind closed doors we are great. But as soon as we are in pubic it's become a different story. Ashley gets a little awkward out in public, and really I'm not much better than her. The few times we have gone out, just the two of us, we are always worried about slipping up and someone seeing us. We have developed this amazing comfort level with each other in the bedroom and when we are alone, but out in the pubic eye we are total noobs. We have control of ourselves and \"act normally\" but we just feel so awkward. We constantly talk about how we wish we could just hold hands and walk through the mall, or kiss each other when we meet somewhere, or talk about plans to move in together the way other couples are able to with their friends and family. It's a work in progress to say the least. I'm sure I'm preaching to the choir on this sub, but I had no idea how much normal relationship stuff is taken for granted until I couldn't really do it.\n\nThose difficulties aside, we are still doing well relationship wise. Even while we are lamenting our lack of ability to be \"normal\" in public, we are definitely still falling even deeper in love. Especially me, since Ashley has spent a lot more time with her feelings than I have with mine. She has only gotten more cute and \"girlfriendish\" with me, as she puts it. We have started watching a lot of television and movies together, only allowing each other to advance through a show when the other is around. We've also had a couple really deep and difficult conversations about our father and that time in our lives since we started \"dating\" and it's helped us grow closer.\n\nAshley and I had a long talk shortly after my last post about our plans with regards to moving. I completely gave up on the idea of leaving Ashley behind, which wasn't a hard decision. It didn't take us long before realizing how right everything feels when we are together. We wanted to try as hard as we could to stay together, so I only looked into jobs that allowed for that.\n\nI finally decided on a really amazing offer from a place that is pretty far away from where we live now, but is still inside the same state. It's about a 5 hour drive from where we live now. There was a school nearby to where I'd be working too. The school had Ashley's major she wanted to pursue and her current grades were more than enough to allow the transfer so she started the transfer process almost immediately. Armed with all of our research and information, we started talking to our Mom to inform her what we were thinking of doing.\n\nMy Mom was expecting me to move out sometime soon anyway, so none of what I proposed to her was a surprise (although she wasn't thrilled about the 5 hour drive to see me). But after I said I would be taking that job, Ashley brought up that she had been wanting to transfer into the school nearby and had already looked into it. My Mom was a little resistant at first, mostly just because she'd be having both of her kids move out in the same time frame, but she accepted it. Ashley went to talk to my Mom in private more, asking her if she thought I would \"be willing to let her move in with me\". My Mom was skeptical at first, assuming I'd be against it, but she brought it up to me and, after offering fake resistance at first, I said it'd make sense to have someone \"split the cost of living with me\" starting out in a new city. Me and Ashley felt like evil geniuses, but really nothing we were doing was that outrageous.\n\nThings moved along steadily and about a week ago we finalized a lot of stuff. Ashley had gotten all of her paperwork at school in order and she had completed the process of applying to the college where we'd be moving so she can transfer in for the Spring semester. I accepted the job and got all of the pre-employment bullshit out of the way (piss test, background checks, etc). I also went up with my Mom to look at apartments and stuff, settling on a duplex/half-house thing outside the city with a decent amount of privacy and an October 1st move-in date (Ashley would move up after she finished her Fall semester at her current school, during her winter break). My Mom even took my sister shopping to look at stuff to buy for the apartment. Once this past weekend rolled around, me and Ashley were starting to get really giddy. The whole plan of moving out and being more free was becoming real and it was exciting, even if she wasn't moving in right away with me.\n\nMy Mom worked this past Friday during the day, but then had a high school reunion to go to. She planned to stay at the hotel that night where they were having the reunion, so she wasn't going to be home until the following day. She let us know she planned to take us out to dinner Saturday night to celebrate my new job and Ashley's pending transfer (a little early but going out to eat as a family doesn't happen often so no complaints). This gave Ash and I the house to ourselves for the entire night Friday, which is the first time that'd happened since we started dating.\n\nOn my way home that evening I texted Ash to see what she was doing. She said my Mom had already left the house for the night. I was about 5 minutes from home and Ashley sent me the greatest 4 words I've ever received via text: \"I'm ready for you...\" Ohhh the anticipation. I mean, I assumed it was something sex-related since I'm not brain dead. But while the easiest part of our relationship has been the physical stuff, there hasn't been much time for a lot of planning or showy romantic nights. I mean, usually it's like \"Ok, Mom's out of the house and she'll be back in X hours\" so we'd do whatever we did with at least SOME sense of urgency. We didn't like to push our luck. But with her out of the house all night, we assumed we could let our hair down a little...\n\nI got home and all of the lights were off inside. I called out to Ashley but I didn't get any response. I walked through the living room and saw light coming from her doorway so I walked down to it. Inside just the light from her night stand was on, which is enough to barely light up the bed and area around it on that side. I stopped after taking a couple steps into the room, frozen by the sight in front of me. Ashley was laying on her side at the edge of the bed facing the door. She was wearing a sexy white lace bra and panty set I had never seen before, and she looked absolutely stunning. She got up off the bed and sauntered over to me slowly, stopping halfway between me and the bed to do a devilishly slow spin, grinning from ear-to-ear at me. Her hair was in pig-tails (which I'm a HUGE fan of on her now lol) which wasn't something I'd seen her do since we were much younger. Now, I've had no problem being able to see my sister as a woman (and not just \"my sister\") for some time now, but after Friday night her being my sister has decidedly taken a back seat to her just being the beautiful woman I love.\n\nShe walked up to me and at first just pressed herself against me and gave me a hug. I figured that night, aside from what she was wearing, would be no different in terms of what \"activities\" we'd be doing. She quietly said \"Hey you...\" before craning her neck up and kissing me. I walked her backwards over to the bed and laid her down on it without a word, unable to control myself. I was laser focused as I began kissing down her neck and tugging at her bra. Before I had a chance to get much further, she sat up a little and grabbed me on either side of my face to kiss me again. She fought against me a little bit as we kissed, eventually making me trade positions so that she got on top of me. She seemed very pleased with herself for not allowing me to drive.\n\nAs we made out she ran her hand down and grabbed at me, tracing my outline through my pants. She kissed me again quickly before proceeding to wiggle her hand into my sweatpants past the waistband. She pulling me out and ran her tongue around the tip. She has learned all of the little things I really enjoy with regards to foreplay, and she is well on her way to mastering them. To be honest, most girls I've been with in the past haven't been very good. Or maybe I am just an asshole and am tough to read/please? Usually I \"lose interest\" and just wind up taking control so we can move on. But with Ashley I usually had to stop her if I didn't want things to end prematurely, so I was totally cool letting her just do whatever she wanted to a point. I mean, she had gone through the trouble of getting all dressed up for me so she obviously had put some thought into our night (is it still called \"dressed up\" if all you're wearing is a bra and panties?)\n\nAfter a couple minutes of her eating me alive she jumped off the bed. She pulled her panties down and then jumped back on top of me in one smooth motion before I had a chance to react. She maneuvered me between her legs so that she was grinding up against my dick. She slowly dragged herself back and forth, sliding herself along the length of me, eventually leaning down so she could try to kiss me again. As she bent down she moved too far forward, causing me to pop out behind her and slide up between her ass. She giggled and reached back, moving me back beneath her. She tried this once or twice more, the same thing happening each time. Everything she was doing obviously felt great for me so I let her have her fun. After fidgeting around a little, she took a deep breath. She rocked back a little bit and I felt myself take a u-turn upwards, and ever so slightly slide up inside her.\n\nI immediately let out a little noise (like \"Whooop!\"), since I knew that feeling and knew I was inadvertently heading into the promised land. I looked up at her and she looked back at me with her brow furrowed. She shifted her weight around as she lifted herself up slightly, popping me back out, then sliding back and forth again. I slid right back into the same position, just barely breaking the threshold into her before she'd move and pop me back out. Ashley did that a few times, biting her lip each time I'd slide into her a little. Meanwhile, I was losing my goddamn mind. The feeling of how tight she was before I'd pop out and then her gliding down the length of me again afterwards could be used to torture guys better than waterboarding. But I let her keep playing around, since the face she had on while doing it was so cute and determined. Eventually she let out a long frustrated moan before collapsing down on my chest. We made out a little bit, as she wiggled her hips around, continuing the tease me. She eventually slid herself back and sat up, my dick popping out and pressing up against the front of her. She held it against her as she rocked back and forth a little bit.\n\n\n**Ashley:** \"Hey...\"\n\n**Me:** \"Hmmmm?\"\n\n**Ashley:** \"...Sooo...\" *Long, excruciating pause*\n\n**Me:** \"Oh my god you're killing me right now!\"\n\n**Ashley:** *laughs* \"I'm sorry! ...\"\n\n**Me:** \"...?\"\n\n**Ashley:** \"I want this...\"\n\nShe gave me a serious look as she squeezed my dick a little and lifted herself up, moving back slightly so that I popped back inside her pussy ever so slightly again.\n\n**Ashley:** \"... in here.\"\n\n\nEverything about Ashley in that situation just made her shine even brighter in my eyes. The little grin she got on her face after she said \"in here\", the way her hips were swaying slightly with anticipation, the look in her eye as I stared at her perched above me... she is just so damn cute and enticing. We were SO CLOSE to moving out, and I had been planning to do something shortly after she moved in with me with regards to us actually having sex. But really, thanks to her, my plans to hold off until we'd moved never stood any chance in a situation like that. Maybe I was stupid to think I needed to hold off or to make it \"more special\" but, regardless, I'm happy Ashley was able to arrive at wanting to do it naturally on her own. Since that first night we fooled around and she told me she was a \"virgin\" I hadn't brought it up again, nor made any attempts to move past foreplay when we'd fool around.\n\nAs that was all crossing my mind, she put both of her hands on my chest. She slowly started moving her hips and lowering herself down onto me, not waiting for me to object. However, she was so tight that she was having difficulties. Without warning she lifted her butt back up and jumped off me. In between giggles she said, \"hang on a second!\". A few moments of sloppy head later, and she jumped back on top of me to try again. I was just laying there, frozen, still wondering if I should put the brakes on. Half of me wanted to stop her, and half of me wanted to just thrust up into her. Obviously the second option wasn't realistic, because I have no doubt that would have been painful for her. A guy can only take so much, though. I ran my hands along her thighs as she tried again, eager to give myself something to do. Each time she got a fraction of an inch further, until eventually she had an inch or 2 of me stuffed inside of her. It was torture for me, despite feeling good and being a lot of fun.\n\n\n**Ashley:** \"... It kinda feels like you're not going to fit...\"\n\n**Me:** \"Ash... you don't have to rush-\"\n\n**Ashley:** \"I want this. I don't want to wait anymore...\"\n\n\nShe looked at me with this overly serious look, but she was blushing like crazy. She knew what she wanted and I'm fairly certain she was going to take it from me if I hadn't given in at that point lol. 'So much for my plans' I thought to myself as I started sitting up.\n\n\n**Me:** \"Ok... let me help then.\"\n\n\nI shoved her off me and moved between her legs. She seemed to enjoy me throwing her around and man-handling her a little bit. I stripped the rest of my clothes off and threw them haphazardly off the bed, not caring where they landed. I kissed her quickly before sliding down so I could lay flat between her legs and eat her out, taking my time to slowly introduce my finger and give it a good wiggle. I was legitimately skeptical that we'd be able to actually fuck without it hurting her. I moved north and started kissing from her neck to her lips as I continued fingering her. Really I was just stalling for time, because I was having a rather difficult time just casually giving myself the OK to take my sister's virginity. I looked her in her eyes for a moment before saying:\n\n\n**Me:** \"You've gotta tell me to keep going... this isn't as easy as you may think for me to just...do...\"\n\n**Ashley:** \"... PLEASE keep going!\"\n\n\nThe expression she had is the same one I've mentioned in previous posts. One that I didn't know existed until after she confessed to me and we started fooling around. Her eyes just get so full of trust and passion that I lose in a battle of willpower against her every time. The \"PLEASE\" was a nice touch as well!\n\nI threw her legs over my shoulders and leaned against them a little. She closed her eyes as I lined myself up and slowly pushed into her. I got about halfway in before her hand shot down and grabbed my leg. I froze and waited a moment before asking if she was ok. She opened her eyes and she shook her head yes. I kept going, until I was almost completely inside her. By then her head had tipped back and her mouth was open a little. I waited another moment and said, \"I'm going to start moving if you're ok...\" She gave me a quick, sharp little nod of her head. I assumed it was only uncomfortable for her at that point, so I pulled out most of the way and slowly slid back in, trying to be as gentle as possible. I was really in awe of just how tight she was, though. Ashley had a hand on each of my legs at that point and was lightly squeezing each time I moved in or out. After a minute or so she was finally starting to loosen up a bit, so I rocked her back a little bit more and pushed into her as deeply as I could go.\n\nAlmost immediately her head shot forward so that she was looking at me, her mouth opening wider. I pulled out only slightly before pushing back in just as deeply several times. She reacted by struggling to reach up for me, getting her fingers onto my face as she tried to pull me down. I leaned down and she kissed me deeply as she wrapped her hands around the back of my head, pulling me forcefully into her. I could feel her shaking a little bit as we kissed. She told me later that she had come after the first few thrusts, and it felt so different from what she was used to that she didn't know what to do with herself at first.\n\nBetween short, quick breaths she said:\n\n\n**Ashley:** \"Holy shit... you... keep going... just... fuck me!\"\n\n\nMy sister talking a little dirty to me was interesting to say the least. I didn't want to go too crazy on her, but at the same time I wanted to give her what she wanted, so I began slowly moving in and out of her as deeply as possible while still bent down close to her face. Her moans started escaping immediately, louder and louder, as I began moving at a more rhythmic pace. Her tone and expressions were different than I'd seen anytime before. Her face was almost in a state of disbelief most of the time, with glassy eyes that communicated how good she was feeling to me in between waves of smiles and intense emotion. I wasn't going for even a minute before I had to slow down. Several times I had to stop completely for a second or 2 just to compose myself because I refused to give in that soon to how good she felt. It was the hardest I've ever had to work to pace myself during sex, but also easily the most rewarding. The sounds and looks I was getting from Ashley would put a smile on any guy's face. I sat up again, picking up pace a little as she laid back against the pillows. After a while she asked me to go slower and deeper again, which I happily obliged. I moved around a little, getting my arms behind her so I could lay closer to her than before and kiss her as I made love to her. And I was definitely \"making love\" to her. Really the first time I have ever even thought it was appropriate to describe the sex I was having in that way. Just saying that we were \"fucking\" really doesn't cover the feelings I had going through me that whole time. I don't really give a shit if anyone thinks that's \"cheesy\" either.\n\nOnly another minute or so later and she got quiet before grabbing and ripping at the sheets around us, my name falling randomly out of her mouth between short gasps and moans. Then all of a sudden she kicked her feet a little, followed up by a loud \"Holy shhh...\" and some arm flailing as she came more intensely than I've ever seen. I kept going, letting her thrash around a little as I continued. I went for as long as I could before finally giving in and finishing on her stomach (which was a first for us, since she always swallowed when she'd give me head).\n\nI collapsed down next to her. I was a sweaty mess, but I couldn't stop smiling. I quickly used the nearest thing available (my shirt) to clean Ashley up before pulling her in close to me, noticing that she had a few tears squeezing out the corners of her tightly shut eyes. She reached out blindly and got her arms around me, hugging herself up against me awkwardly as she still convulsed lightly. She repeated, \"Oh my god, (my name), oh my god...\" in an exhausted whisper a few times into my ear. After a deep breath she pulled the remaining hair tie out (one pigtail had come out during sex), letting the rest of her hair fall messily around her. She swept it all up behind her as she put her head on my shoulder.\n\nIt was so god damn satisfying for me laying together with her after that. Every fiber of my being was smiling at her reactions and what she had said to me throughout. Ashley kissed my cheek and I turned and kissed her on the lips softly. She smiled at me, eyes still a little teary, as she laid her head back down on my shoulder.\n\n\n**Ashley:** \"... Kinda can't believe we just did that...\"\n\n\nShe moved her hands down between her legs and just kinda cupped herself and felt around a little bit, poking and prodding herself a bit before looking at me and giving me a little smirk.\n\n\n**Ashley:** \"I think I'm getting sore already!\"\n\n**Me:** \"I believe it. I definitely believe it. You were incredible though, Ash. You're ok right? It didn't hurt a lot did it?\"\n\n**Ashley:** \"...I'm ok... I used to imagine it, ya know? I used to play with myself and imagine you doing stuff to me... I feel like I'm floating right now... it felt so good... I'm definitely going to be a little more sore than I imagined, but I think it was still worth it!\"\n\n\nWe both laughed like crazy. I'm not really sure what I expected her to say in that situation. But seeing her laugh and smile, after having sex for the first time, knowing she had been a virgin just a little while before that... and knowing that she willingly gave that up to me... there just aren't any words. We talked more, mostly about the sex and us moving in together, and eventually we fell asleep next to each other. Our Mom wasn't getting home until the afternoon the following day, so we had the time. Or at least we thought we had the time. As it turns out, we really didn't.\n\nUnfortunately, as I mentioned, I'm not just posting because I wanted to give a nice happy update to everyone after we were already moved in together (which is when I would have originally preferred to have been posting).\n\nWe woke up the following morning early, around 6am. It was our first time sleeping next to each other for the whole night. Waking up next to her was not something I planned on having happen until we were moved in together. Needless to say I was thrilled to get an early preview of how things would eventually be. I rolled toward the window and looked outside through the blinds. The driveway was empty, so Mom was still out. 'Perfect' I thought. Ashley was still sleeping so I threw my arm over her and fell back asleep for a while. I woke up again to her rolling over and kissing me.\n\n\n**Ashley:** \"Ok... I officially love waking up next to you. How can I possibly go back to sleeping alone now?\"\n\n**Me:** \"Well that's great news, considering I splurged on a king size bed for 'our' new room.\"\n\n**Ashley:** \"Our room... that sounds kinda crazy, right?\"\n\n**Me:** \"Crazy is definitely the word I've been using. Especially with regards to you!\n\n\nI paused to look at her, laying there in all her naked glory. If that was how it was going to be after we moved in together, I'm worried about her actually making it to classes every morning. It was going to be hard to let her leave.\n\n\n**Me:** \" ...So hey... how sore are you... exactly?\n\n\nBefore she could answer I gave her a goofy look as I closed in and kissed her. As far as I was concerned it was now open season on Ashley's and I had no inhibitions holding me back anymore. We were both already naked (except I had thrown on a pair of boxers the night before, I hate sleeping totally naked) so I just rolled on top of her as we kissed. I reached down and got a finger inside of her, slowly loosening her up a bit. Eventually I slipped myself out of my boxers and thrust into her. She was all smiles, but as soon as I pushed into her she grabbed the sheets and got loud. It took way less effort to loosen her up than the previous night, and before long she was moaning up a storm. After a while we both came and collapsed back against each other in bed. We'd only been doing missionary so far, but it was already becoming so easy and fun. Even after only one night I could feel how compatible we were. Things just fit together the right way, there is no other way to describe it.\n\nAfter just basking in each other's glory for a little while, I looked at the clock and it was 7:30am. I figured it was time for us to untangle ourselves from each other and get the day started so that we were \"decent\" when my Mom got home. Ashley rolled back over and pulled the covers up over her. I jumped out of bed and hunted down my boxers before kissing Ashley quick and heading for the door. I flung the door open and took a step into the hallway... and I felt my stomach drop into my feet.\n\nCoffee. Coffee was all I smelled. My brain was still bogged down with images of Ashley naked and fuzz from a long night of sex and sleep, so I didn't put 2 and 2 together right away. 'Why does it smell like coffee?' Perhaps because someone had made some? Jesus fucking christ. I walked down the hall and peaked in across the living room to the kitchen. Sitting at the kitchen table, with the coffee maker going in the background, was my older sister.\n\nI ducked back down the hallway again. 'Holy shit. How long had she been there? She DEFINITELY wasn't there the night before.' Then it dawned on me: it didn't matter how long she had been there. If she had been there longer than even 15 minutes, she heard EVERYTHING that just happened in that house. Our house is a fucking LIBRARY when nobody is home. You can literally hear a fucking pin drop.\n\nI scooted back down the hallway and into the bathroom, which was going to be my original destination. As I attempted to pee (which took a minute because I had just gotten done FUCKING ASHLEY), I was simultaneously shitting my pants. And I didn't even have pants on. And yes, these jokes are just a product of how much I am, even right now as I am writing this, still shitting my pants. I have a habit of diffusing awkward or shitty situations with humor, so sue me.\n\nWhat the hell can you even do in that situation? I jumped in the shower, unsure of what to do besides wash the sex off me while trying to think of what to say. If she had been there that morning, my older sis (\"Sarah\") DEFINITELY heard EVERYTHING. I could only hope that by some miracle she had arrived afterwards or hadn't heard. The craziest part about it is that she lives far away (at least 4 hour drive, usually 5 the way she drives). And she never just comes for a visit for the heck of it. She literally never just \"drops in\". It's always a planned visit, with her girlfriend and kids, for a whole weekend at least.\n\nI got out of the shower after just a few minutes and went down to my room to throw shorts and a shirt on. I didn't think there was anything else to do other than just go say hi to Sarah and hope for the best. I made my way down the hall and into the living room. As I approached the kitchen, I faked some surprise in my voice the best I could.\n\n\n**Me:** \"Whoa! Hey! What are you doing here? Mom didn't say anything about you coming by!\"\n\n**Sarah:** \"Hey how's it going?\"\n\nShe smiled weakly, and stood up. We hugged quick, and she sat back down.\n\n**Me:** \"Good. Really good. I'm assuming you know I'm moving to (new town) soon?\"\n\n**Sarah:** \"I'll say, it sounded like things were going 'really good' for you back there!\"\n\n\nShe smiled much bigger this time, like she had said something hilarious, completely avoiding my attempt at deflection. But what a terrible feeling that was. I assumed she knew. Fuck me, she knew and I was about to spiral off into a vortex of shit.\n\n\n**Me:** \"Uhh... did you hear anyth-\"\n\n**Sarah:** \"How could I not?! I know it isn't (ex-girlfriend) anymore, so who is it? Anyone I know?\"\n\n'Holy fuck, ok... So she hadn't put it together yet.' I thought to myself.\n\n**Me:** \"Hahaha, oh... nobody you know. She's uh... not decent right now or I'd introduce you.\"\n\n**Sarah:** \"I bet, nothing sounded decent about what was coming from that hallway before. Does Mom know about this? You know back in the day I would always get in trouble if I had someone over the house when she wasn't home!\"\n\n\nBy that point my imaginary pants were dragging on the ground from all the imaginary shit packed into them. How the fuck could I possibly play that off? 'There is no fucking imaginary girl that can come out of my room right now', I thought to myself. I had dug myself a hole that I was standing in the middle of as it was filling with liquid shit for me to drown in.\n\nAnd, like clockwork, that's when Ashley walked in. And she walked in not expecting Sarah to be there (obviously). And by that I mean, she walked in dressed only in the sexy white bra and panties she had been wearing the night before (which still looked great BTW).\n\nI turned around, away from Sarah, as she walked into the room. Ashley just stopped for a second and stared at us. Sarah reacted first, exclaiming, \"Jesus girl, put some clothes on!\". Ashley didn't move at first. She was just frozen. Not waiting for her to react, I immediately turned away from her and yelled, \"Fuck Ash, seriously!\". She finally got the hint, yelling \"Ahh!!\" before spinning around and running back to her room, slamming the door at the end of the hallway.\n\nI laughed nervously, since it was even worse that Sarah knew Ashley was home as well. It was definitely my fault too, since I should have gone back and warned Ashley that Sarah was there. But I figured she had gone back to sleep. Yes, I'm an idiot.\n\n\n**Sarah:** \"What the actual fuck, you guys just walk around here naked now since I moved out?\"\n\n\nI couldn't actually tell if she was joking or not because of how loudly 'The End of the World As We Know It' was playing inside my head.\n\n\n**Me:** \"No, that was all new for me too.\"\n\n\nAfter I said that I could only think about all the stories I had read before I had even confronted Ashley about her getting into the shower with me that day. So many of the \"disaster\" stories and the other stuff I had read about when relationships like I had with Ashley went poorly were because of lies and them being uncovered. It's literally the one thing I wanted to avoid: lying to people directly about me and Ashley. It hadn't even been 4 weeks and there I was, fresh off my first real sex with Ashley, lying to my older sister about everything.\n\n\n**Sarah:** \"Pretty fancy getup she had on too. I don't think I even own anything that sexy. I should ask her where she got it!\"\n\n**Me:** \"I was too busy averting my eyes to notice!\"\n\n**Sarah:** \"Haha, I bet.\"\n\nI laughed nervously, unsure what to do. I kinda looked back toward the hallway, wondering if there was some way to get out of that situation.\n\n**Me:** \"So... what are you doing here? Mom didn't mention you coming down. She won't be home for another couple hours at least. She had her reunion yesterday.\"\n\n**Sarah:** \"Yeah I spoke with her last night. She was in rare form, pretty drunk on the phone with me. She told me to come down if I had time today. She wants to take us all out to eat tonight. Have everyone together before you move out. Ashley is going to be leaving her now too, so I think she is just feeling a little conscious of that.\"\n\n**Me:** \"Mom's got empty nest syndrome already, huh?\"\n\n**Sarah:** \"Yeah, definitely. You guys are moving far too! Almost as far as I am, and in the opposite direction!\"\n\n\nWe kept chatting a little more. My sister actually made me think a little about my Mom and how we were leaving her alone. Made me feel kinda bad about everything. My Dad had left her, then Sarah, and now she was going to be losing me and Ashley too. We're all gonna have to make an effort to see her more after we move out. But regardless, I was happy to be off the topic of what had just happened. After a while Sarah looked toward the bedroom hallway.\n\n**Sarah:** \"So is your girlfriend sleeping back there? You planning to have her come to dinner with us?\"\n\n**Me:** \"No, definitely not. It should just be the four of us. Speaking of which, (Sarah's Girlfriend) isn't coming?\"\n\n**Sarah:** \"No, she had to work today.\"\n\n**Me:** \"Ok... well let me go see what is going on back there...\"\n\nI got up and walked away, glancing back to give Sarah a quick smile as she watched me walk away. As soon as I was out of sight, I opened the door to my room and then closed it again without entering before tip-toeing down to my sister's room. I quietly opened the door and stuck my head in. Ashley was in her bed curled up in a little ball. She hadn't gotten dressed. I walked over to her and she rolled over. She had been crying, since her eyes were all red and puffy.\n\n**Ashley:** *whispering* \"Oh my god, we're fucked right? Tell me we're not fucked right now... oh my god... I'm such an idiot... \"\n\nShe was obviously shitting her pants just as much as I was.\n\n**Me:** \"No, but she did hear us before-\"\n\n**Ashley:** \"Ohhh jesus fuck-\"\n\n**Me:** \"-she thinks I have a girl in my room. Ash, listen to me. You need to calm your shit down, get dressed, and then get Sarah OUT of there. I can just say my 'girlfriend' left before she got a chance to introduce herself, and it'll be fine.\"\n\nAshley shook her head ok and started getting up. Really I was trying to convince myself that everything would be fine just as much as I was her. I hustled over to the door and whipped it open so I could head back to my room. Unfortunately, of course, Sarah was already in the hallway only a few steps from Ashley's door. I walked out and closed the door behind me.\n\n**Sarah:** \"... she change yet?\"\n\n**Me:** \"Hahaha, not yet.\"\n\n**Sarah:** \"Why the hell did she let you in there then?\"\n\nSarah laughed, but kinda halfheartedly. I am NOT good at lying.\n\n**Me:** \"Great question. Going to check on my girl. Be right back.\"\n\nI hot footed it down to my room, walked in and closed the door. I heard Sarah knock on Ashley's door and Ashley tell her to come in. I could hear indistinct mumbling coming from them as I sat on my bed. I waited 5 minutes (that's enough time to have seen if my \"girlfriend\" was awake yet right?) before coming back out. Sarah was still in Ashley's room so I walked to the kitchen and got a cup of coffee before sitting at the kitchen table. My heart was still racing as I hoped for some kind of miracle to happen. Another 5 minutes had gone by and Sarah still hadn't come out of Ashley's room. I went back to my room and rummaged around a bit. Another 5 minutes. The fuck were they doing in there? I took the opportunity to make my move. I ran to the front hall and opened and closed the door loudly and then scurried back into the kitchen to my coffee and sat back down.\n\nGGGOOOAAALLL!!!!! I was so relieved. I could only hope that was enough to convince Sarah that someone had just left the house. Another few minutes went by and eventually Ashley and Sarah came back out to the kitchen. I told Sarah that my girlfriend had actually overslept so she had to go real quickly. The \"devil is in the details\" though, right?\n\n**Sarah:** \"Wait how the hell did she leave? Did she park on the street too?\" (that explains why Sarah's car hadn't been in the driveway, she parked on the street out of view)\n\n**Me:** \"... she called an Uber, she just hustled out of here.\"\n\n**Sarah:** \"Weird...\"\n\nI changed the topic, saying I'd introduce her next time or if she was planning on staying longer than just that day. The rest of the day went on normally. My Mom got home with a huge hangover in the early afternoon. She took a nap while me, Sarah, and Ashley all hung out and watched TV and caught up. Sarah is actually a really awesome person, and not just because she's family. She is a lot of fun to be around despite being a good deal older than us, but you'd never know it. She is a big kid. She's gone through some pretty tough times and dealt with a lot of hate/ridicule because of her life choices and being gay, especially back when she was in school and stuff wasn't as accepted as it is today, which thankfully made her a very outspoken and open person later in life rather than it going the other way. I have thought that Sarah would be the only one I'd think might understand what me and Ashley had decided to pursue, but that didn't mean I wanted to test that theory.\n\nSo that evening was fine and we had a good time out as a family. Ashley and I were just normal brother and sister all night, and it was great having our family back together for a night out. Sarah decided that she wanted to go home that night so she'd have a Sunday to relax with her family before going back to work Monday. She gave me and Ashley little gifts for our new place (small little knickknacks to brighten up the living room area) before taking off. Ashley and I talked that night back at the house after Mom went to sleep, and we both agree that we were stupid for falling asleep together and not checking the house before having sex again the following morning. We chalked it up to a learning experience and vowed to never be that lackadaisical again.\n\nLater that night, when I was in my room playing some games alone, my phone buzzed. I checked it and it was a text from Sarah. It said:\n\n**Sarah (*via text*):** \"So I'm not sure why you would have lied to me, but I know that there was no Uber. Or girlfriend for that matter.\"\n\nI sat up and stared at the phone for what seemed like an hour. My first impulse was to go show Ashley, but I decided against it. At least not until I had collected my thoughts and tried to come up with what to reply with. I didn't reply, and a few more texts came in eventually:\n\n**Sarah (*via text*):** \"I could see outside the whole time. Didn't see anyone walk out. Part of me thinks you didn't even have anyone in your room, but I'm kinda confused as to what to even think if that was the case. Care to comment?\"\n\nBut I never did reply. I had no idea what to say. Part of me feels like Sarah may know more than she is leading on. Lying to her more and her knowing I am lying would just dig my hole deeper. I never expected to have to be dealing with a situation like this before we moved out of my fucking Mom's house, but here I am. It's not like she walked in on us, and I have no idea what she heard, if anything, or what she is thinking was going on.\n\nI was hoping writing this all out would help me clear my head and figure out what the do, but it really hasn't. If anyone has some advice for dealing with a situation like this, I'm all ears (or eyes I guess). Is there anyway to come out of this without a complete shit show? I was just going to deny whatever she has in her head and hope for the best, but I have no idea if that's the right way to go. I really need to reply to her soon though (preferably in the next 24-48 hours) since it's been a couple days since she texted me. She hasn't sent any other messages since then, but she probably thinks it's weird I haven't replied already.\n\nThanks in advance for any advice!",

A lot has happened. Some good, some bad, some crazy. Honestly I didn&amp;#39;t expect to be back here posting so soon. I have a lot to get through first before I can get to the reason I&amp;#39;m really here, so I&amp;#39;ll dive right in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Good news first: I officially graduated from college (technically I already had but I got my diploma finally). There was a smaller ceremony for those who graduated over the summer, and my mom got to take pictures of me in my robe, so everything worked out. Once I had my diploma in hand things started moving quickly, as most job offers I had received already were just waiting on a copy of my diploma to finalize things. I began the process of deciding where I wanted to go, keeping in mind my relationship with Ashley the whole time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The last 4 weeks have been a learning curve for me and Ashley. The good times have been really good, but living at home and trying to hide a relationship with your sister is exhausting. Even with a Mom who is out of the house a lot it&amp;#39;s rough. We have been growing more intimate with each other as time has gone by, exploring each other and our relationship more. That has been the easiest part for us. What we&amp;#39;ve found is that it is tough to do things as a couple outside of the house. Behind closed doors we are great. But as soon as we are in pubic it&amp;#39;s become a different story. Ashley gets a little awkward out in public, and really I&amp;#39;m not much better than her. The few times we have gone out, just the two of us, we are always worried about slipping up and someone seeing us. We have developed this amazing comfort level with each other in the bedroom and when we are alone, but out in the pubic eye we are total noobs. We have control of ourselves and &amp;quot;act normally&amp;quot; but we just feel so awkward. We constantly talk about how we wish we could just hold hands and walk through the mall, or kiss each other when we meet somewhere, or talk about plans to move in together the way other couples are able to with their friends and family. It&amp;#39;s a work in progress to say the least. I&amp;#39;m sure I&amp;#39;m preaching to the choir on this sub, but I had no idea how much normal relationship stuff is taken for granted until I couldn&amp;#39;t really do it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those difficulties aside, we are still doing well relationship wise. Even while we are lamenting our lack of ability to be &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot; in public, we are definitely still falling even deeper in love. Especially me, since Ashley has spent a lot more time with her feelings than I have with mine. She has only gotten more cute and &amp;quot;girlfriendish&amp;quot; with me, as she puts it. We have started watching a lot of television and movies together, only allowing each other to advance through a show when the other is around. We&amp;#39;ve also had a couple really deep and difficult conversations about our father and that time in our lives since we started &amp;quot;dating&amp;quot; and it&amp;#39;s helped us grow closer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ashley and I had a long talk shortly after my last post about our plans with regards to moving. I completely gave up on the idea of leaving Ashley behind, which wasn&amp;#39;t a hard decision. It didn&amp;#39;t take us long before realizing how right everything feels when we are together. We wanted to try as hard as we could to stay together, so I only looked into jobs that allowed for that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I finally decided on a really amazing offer from a place that is pretty far away from where we live now, but is still inside the same state. It&amp;#39;s about a 5 hour drive from where we live now. There was a school nearby to where I&amp;#39;d be working too. The school had Ashley&amp;#39;s major she wanted to pursue and her current grades were more than enough to allow the transfer so she started the transfer process almost immediately. Armed with all of our research and information, we started talking to our Mom to inform her what we were thinking of doing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My Mom was expecting me to move out sometime soon anyway, so none of what I proposed to her was a surprise (although she wasn&amp;#39;t thrilled about the 5 hour drive to see me). But after I said I would be taking that job, Ashley brought up that she had been wanting to transfer into the school nearby and had already looked into it. My Mom was a little resistant at first, mostly just because she&amp;#39;d be having both of her kids move out in the same time frame, but she accepted it. Ashley went to talk to my Mom in private more, asking her if she thought I would &amp;quot;be willing to let her move in with me&amp;quot;. My Mom was skeptical at first, assuming I&amp;#39;d be against it, but she brought it up to me and, after offering fake resistance at first, I said it&amp;#39;d make sense to have someone &amp;quot;split the cost of living with me&amp;quot; starting out in a new city. Me and Ashley felt like evil geniuses, but really nothing we were doing was that outrageous.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Things moved along steadily and about a week ago we finalized a lot of stuff. Ashley had gotten all of her paperwork at school in order and she had completed the process of applying to the college where we&amp;#39;d be moving so she can transfer in for the Spring semester. I accepted the job and got all of the pre-employment bullshit out of the way (piss test, background checks, etc). I also went up with my Mom to look at apartments and stuff, settling on a duplex/half-house thing outside the city with a decent amount of privacy and an October 1st move-in date (Ashley would move up after she finished her Fall semester at her current school, during her winter break). My Mom even took my sister shopping to look at stuff to buy for the apartment. Once this past weekend rolled around, me and Ashley were starting to get really giddy. The whole plan of moving out and being more free was becoming real and it was exciting, even if she wasn&amp;#39;t moving in right away with me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My Mom worked this past Friday during the day, but then had a high school reunion to go to. She planned to stay at the hotel that night where they were having the reunion, so she wasn&amp;#39;t going to be home until the following day. She let us know she planned to take us out to dinner Saturday night to celebrate my new job and Ashley&amp;#39;s pending transfer (a little early but going out to eat as a family doesn&amp;#39;t happen often so no complaints). This gave Ash and I the house to ourselves for the entire night Friday, which is the first time that&amp;#39;d happened since we started dating.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On my way home that evening I texted Ash to see what she was doing. She said my Mom had already left the house for the night. I was about 5 minutes from home and Ashley sent me the greatest 4 words I&amp;#39;ve ever received via text: &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m ready for you...&amp;quot; Ohhh the anticipation. I mean, I assumed it was something sex-related since I&amp;#39;m not brain dead. But while the easiest part of our relationship has been the physical stuff, there hasn&amp;#39;t been much time for a lot of planning or showy romantic nights. I mean, usually it&amp;#39;s like &amp;quot;Ok, Mom&amp;#39;s out of the house and she&amp;#39;ll be back in X hours&amp;quot; so we&amp;#39;d do whatever we did with at least SOME sense of urgency. We didn&amp;#39;t like to push our luck. But with her out of the house all night, we assumed we could let our hair down a little...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got home and all of the lights were off inside. I called out to Ashley but I didn&amp;#39;t get any response. I walked through the living room and saw light coming from her doorway so I walked down to it. Inside just the light from her night stand was on, which is enough to barely light up the bed and area around it on that side. I stopped after taking a couple steps into the room, frozen by the sight in front of me. Ashley was laying on her side at the edge of the bed facing the door. She was wearing a sexy white lace bra and panty set I had never seen before, and she looked absolutely stunning. She got up off the bed and sauntered over to me slowly, stopping halfway between me and the bed to do a devilishly slow spin, grinning from ear-to-ear at me. Her hair was in pig-tails (which I&amp;#39;m a HUGE fan of on her now lol) which wasn&amp;#39;t something I&amp;#39;d seen her do since we were much younger. Now, I&amp;#39;ve had no problem being able to see my sister as a woman (and not just &amp;quot;my sister&amp;quot;) for some time now, but after Friday night her being my sister has decidedly taken a back seat to her just being the beautiful woman I love.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She walked up to me and at first just pressed herself against me and gave me a hug. I figured that night, aside from what she was wearing, would be no different in terms of what &amp;quot;activities&amp;quot; we&amp;#39;d be doing. She quietly said &amp;quot;Hey you...&amp;quot; before craning her neck up and kissing me. I walked her backwards over to the bed and laid her down on it without a word, unable to control myself. I was laser focused as I began kissing down her neck and tugging at her bra. Before I had a chance to get much further, she sat up a little and grabbed me on either side of my face to kiss me again. She fought against me a little bit as we kissed, eventually making me trade positions so that she got on top of me. She seemed very pleased with herself for not allowing me to drive.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As we made out she ran her hand down and grabbed at me, tracing my outline through my pants. She kissed me again quickly before proceeding to wiggle her hand into my sweatpants past the waistband. She pulling me out and ran her tongue around the tip. She has learned all of the little things I really enjoy with regards to foreplay, and she is well on her way to mastering them. To be honest, most girls I&amp;#39;ve been with in the past haven&amp;#39;t been very good. Or maybe I am just an asshole and am tough to read/please? Usually I &amp;quot;lose interest&amp;quot; and just wind up taking control so we can move on. But with Ashley I usually had to stop her if I didn&amp;#39;t want things to end prematurely, so I was totally cool letting her just do whatever she wanted to a point. I mean, she had gone through the trouble of getting all dressed up for me so she obviously had put some thought into our night (is it still called &amp;quot;dressed up&amp;quot; if all you&amp;#39;re wearing is a bra and panties?)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After a couple minutes of her eating me alive she jumped off the bed. She pulled her panties down and then jumped back on top of me in one smooth motion before I had a chance to react. She maneuvered me between her legs so that she was grinding up against my dick. She slowly dragged herself back and forth, sliding herself along the length of me, eventually leaning down so she could try to kiss me again. As she bent down she moved too far forward, causing me to pop out behind her and slide up between her ass. She giggled and reached back, moving me back beneath her. She tried this once or twice more, the same thing happening each time. Everything she was doing obviously felt great for me so I let her have her fun. After fidgeting around a little, she took a deep breath. She rocked back a little bit and I felt myself take a u-turn upwards, and ever so slightly slide up inside her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I immediately let out a little noise (like &amp;quot;Whooop!&amp;quot;), since I knew that feeling and knew I was inadvertently heading into the promised land. I looked up at her and she looked back at me with her brow furrowed. She shifted her weight around as she lifted herself up slightly, popping me back out, then sliding back and forth again. I slid right back into the same position, just barely breaking the threshold into her before she&amp;#39;d move and pop me back out. Ashley did that a few times, biting her lip each time I&amp;#39;d slide into her a little. Meanwhile, I was losing my goddamn mind. The feeling of how tight she was before I&amp;#39;d pop out and then her gliding down the length of me again afterwards could be used to torture guys better than waterboarding. But I let her keep playing around, since the face she had on while doing it was so cute and determined. Eventually she let out a long frustrated moan before collapsing down on my chest. We made out a little bit, as she wiggled her hips around, continuing the tease me. She eventually slid herself back and sat up, my dick popping out and pressing up against the front of her. She held it against her as she rocked back and forth a little bit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ashley:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;Hey...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;Hmmmm?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ashley:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;...Sooo...&amp;quot; &lt;em&gt;Long, excruciating pause&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;Oh my god you&amp;#39;re killing me right now!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ashley:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;laughs&lt;/em&gt; &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m sorry! ...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;...?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ashley:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;I want this...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She gave me a serious look as she squeezed my dick a little and lifted herself up, moving back slightly so that I popped back inside her pussy ever so slightly again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ashley:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;... in here.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Everything about Ashley in that situation just made her shine even brighter in my eyes. The little grin she got on her face after she said &amp;quot;in here&amp;quot;, the way her hips were swaying slightly with anticipation, the look in her eye as I stared at her perched above me... she is just so damn cute and enticing. We were SO CLOSE to moving out, and I had been planning to do something shortly after she moved in with me with regards to us actually having sex. But really, thanks to her, my plans to hold off until we&amp;#39;d moved never stood any chance in a situation like that. Maybe I was stupid to think I needed to hold off or to make it &amp;quot;more special&amp;quot; but, regardless, I&amp;#39;m happy Ashley was able to arrive at wanting to do it naturally on her own. Since that first night we fooled around and she told me she was a &amp;quot;virgin&amp;quot; I hadn&amp;#39;t brought it up again, nor made any attempts to move past foreplay when we&amp;#39;d fool around.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As that was all crossing my mind, she put both of her hands on my chest. She slowly started moving her hips and lowering herself down onto me, not waiting for me to object. However, she was so tight that she was having difficulties. Without warning she lifted her butt back up and jumped off me. In between giggles she said, &amp;quot;hang on a second!&amp;quot;. A few moments of sloppy head later, and she jumped back on top of me to try again. I was just laying there, frozen, still wondering if I should put the brakes on. Half of me wanted to stop her, and half of me wanted to just thrust up into her. Obviously the second option wasn&amp;#39;t realistic, because I have no doubt that would have been painful for her. A guy can only take so much, though. I ran my hands along her thighs as she tried again, eager to give myself something to do. Each time she got a fraction of an inch further, until eventually she had an inch or 2 of me stuffed inside of her. It was torture for me, despite feeling good and being a lot of fun.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ashley:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;... It kinda feels like you&amp;#39;re not going to fit...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;Ash... you don&amp;#39;t have to rush-&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ashley:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;I want this. I don&amp;#39;t want to wait anymore...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She looked at me with this overly serious look, but she was blushing like crazy. She knew what she wanted and I&amp;#39;m fairly certain she was going to take it from me if I hadn&amp;#39;t given in at that point lol. &amp;#39;So much for my plans&amp;#39; I thought to myself as I started sitting up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;Ok... let me help then.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I shoved her off me and moved between her legs. She seemed to enjoy me throwing her around and man-handling her a little bit. I stripped the rest of my clothes off and threw them haphazardly off the bed, not caring where they landed. I kissed her quickly before sliding down so I could lay flat between her legs and eat her out, taking my time to slowly introduce my finger and give it a good wiggle. I was legitimately skeptical that we&amp;#39;d be able to actually fuck without it hurting her. I moved north and started kissing from her neck to her lips as I continued fingering her. Really I was just stalling for time, because I was having a rather difficult time just casually giving myself the OK to take my sister&amp;#39;s virginity. I looked her in her eyes for a moment before saying:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;You&amp;#39;ve gotta tell me to keep going... this isn&amp;#39;t as easy as you may think for me to just...do...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ashley:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;... PLEASE keep going!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The expression she had is the same one I&amp;#39;ve mentioned in previous posts. One that I didn&amp;#39;t know existed until after she confessed to me and we started fooling around. Her eyes just get so full of trust and passion that I lose in a battle of willpower against her every time. The &amp;quot;PLEASE&amp;quot; was a nice touch as well!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I threw her legs over my shoulders and leaned against them a little. She closed her eyes as I lined myself up and slowly pushed into her. I got about halfway in before her hand shot down and grabbed my leg. I froze and waited a moment before asking if she was ok. She opened her eyes and she shook her head yes. I kept going, until I was almost completely inside her. By then her head had tipped back and her mouth was open a little. I waited another moment and said, &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m going to start moving if you&amp;#39;re ok...&amp;quot; She gave me a quick, sharp little nod of her head. I assumed it was only uncomfortable for her at that point, so I pulled out most of the way and slowly slid back in, trying to be as gentle as possible. I was really in awe of just how tight she was, though. Ashley had a hand on each of my legs at that point and was lightly squeezing each time I moved in or out. After a minute or so she was finally starting to loosen up a bit, so I rocked her back a little bit more and pushed into her as deeply as I could go.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Almost immediately her head shot forward so that she was looking at me, her mouth opening wider. I pulled out only slightly before pushing back in just as deeply several times. She reacted by struggling to reach up for me, getting her fingers onto my face as she tried to pull me down. I leaned down and she kissed me deeply as she wrapped her hands around the back of my head, pulling me forcefully into her. I could feel her shaking a little bit as we kissed. She told me later that she had come after the first few thrusts, and it felt so different from what she was used to that she didn&amp;#39;t know what to do with herself at first.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Between short, quick breaths she said:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ashley:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;Holy shit... you... keep going... just... fuck me!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My sister talking a little dirty to me was interesting to say the least. I didn&amp;#39;t want to go too crazy on her, but at the same time I wanted to give her what she wanted, so I began slowly moving in and out of her as deeply as possible while still bent down close to her face. Her moans started escaping immediately, louder and louder, as I began moving at a more rhythmic pace. Her tone and expressions were different than I&amp;#39;d seen anytime before. Her face was almost in a state of disbelief most of the time, with glassy eyes that communicated how good she was feeling to me in between waves of smiles and intense emotion. I wasn&amp;#39;t going for even a minute before I had to slow down. Several times I had to stop completely for a second or 2 just to compose myself because I refused to give in that soon to how good she felt. It was the hardest I&amp;#39;ve ever had to work to pace myself during sex, but also easily the most rewarding. The sounds and looks I was getting from Ashley would put a smile on any guy&amp;#39;s face. I sat up again, picking up pace a little as she laid back against the pillows. After a while she asked me to go slower and deeper again, which I happily obliged. I moved around a little, getting my arms behind her so I could lay closer to her than before and kiss her as I made love to her. And I was definitely &amp;quot;making love&amp;quot; to her. Really the first time I have ever even thought it was appropriate to describe the sex I was having in that way. Just saying that we were &amp;quot;fucking&amp;quot; really doesn&amp;#39;t cover the feelings I had going through me that whole time. I don&amp;#39;t really give a shit if anyone thinks that&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;cheesy&amp;quot; either.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Only another minute or so later and she got quiet before grabbing and ripping at the sheets around us, my name falling randomly out of her mouth between short gasps and moans. Then all of a sudden she kicked her feet a little, followed up by a loud &amp;quot;Holy shhh...&amp;quot; and some arm flailing as she came more intensely than I&amp;#39;ve ever seen. I kept going, letting her thrash around a little as I continued. I went for as long as I could before finally giving in and finishing on her stomach (which was a first for us, since she always swallowed when she&amp;#39;d give me head).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I collapsed down next to her. I was a sweaty mess, but I couldn&amp;#39;t stop smiling. I quickly used the nearest thing available (my shirt) to clean Ashley up before pulling her in close to me, noticing that she had a few tears squeezing out the corners of her tightly shut eyes. She reached out blindly and got her arms around me, hugging herself up against me awkwardly as she still convulsed lightly. She repeated, &amp;quot;Oh my god, (my name), oh my god...&amp;quot; in an exhausted whisper a few times into my ear. After a deep breath she pulled the remaining hair tie out (one pigtail had come out during sex), letting the rest of her hair fall messily around her. She swept it all up behind her as she put her head on my shoulder.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was so god damn satisfying for me laying together with her after that. Every fiber of my being was smiling at her reactions and what she had said to me throughout. Ashley kissed my cheek and I turned and kissed her on the lips softly. She smiled at me, eyes still a little teary, as she laid her head back down on my shoulder.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ashley:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;... Kinda can&amp;#39;t believe we just did that...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She moved her hands down between her legs and just kinda cupped herself and felt around a little bit, poking and prodding herself a bit before looking at me and giving me a little smirk.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ashley:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;I think I&amp;#39;m getting sore already!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;I believe it. I definitely believe it. You were incredible though, Ash. You&amp;#39;re ok right? It didn&amp;#39;t hurt a lot did it?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ashley:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;...I&amp;#39;m ok... I used to imagine it, ya know? I used to play with myself and imagine you doing stuff to me... I feel like I&amp;#39;m floating right now... it felt so good... I&amp;#39;m definitely going to be a little more sore than I imagined, but I think it was still worth it!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We both laughed like crazy. I&amp;#39;m not really sure what I expected her to say in that situation. But seeing her laugh and smile, after having sex for the first time, knowing she had been a virgin just a little while before that... and knowing that she willingly gave that up to me... there just aren&amp;#39;t any words. We talked more, mostly about the sex and us moving in together, and eventually we fell asleep next to each other. Our Mom wasn&amp;#39;t getting home until the afternoon the following day, so we had the time. Or at least we thought we had the time. As it turns out, we really didn&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, as I mentioned, I&amp;#39;m not just posting because I wanted to give a nice happy update to everyone after we were already moved in together (which is when I would have originally preferred to have been posting).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We woke up the following morning early, around 6am. It was our first time sleeping next to each other for the whole night. Waking up next to her was not something I planned on having happen until we were moved in together. Needless to say I was thrilled to get an early preview of how things would eventually be. I rolled toward the window and looked outside through the blinds. The driveway was empty, so Mom was still out. &amp;#39;Perfect&amp;#39; I thought. Ashley was still sleeping so I threw my arm over her and fell back asleep for a while. I woke up again to her rolling over and kissing me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ashley:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;Ok... I officially love waking up next to you. How can I possibly go back to sleeping alone now?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;Well that&amp;#39;s great news, considering I splurged on a king size bed for &amp;#39;our&amp;#39; new room.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ashley:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;Our room... that sounds kinda crazy, right?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;Crazy is definitely the word I&amp;#39;ve been using. Especially with regards to you!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I paused to look at her, laying there in all her naked glory. If that was how it was going to be after we moved in together, I&amp;#39;m worried about her actually making it to classes every morning. It was going to be hard to let her leave.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot; ...So hey... how sore are you... exactly?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Before she could answer I gave her a goofy look as I closed in and kissed her. As far as I was concerned it was now open season on Ashley&amp;#39;s and I had no inhibitions holding me back anymore. We were both already naked (except I had thrown on a pair of boxers the night before, I hate sleeping totally naked) so I just rolled on top of her as we kissed. I reached down and got a finger inside of her, slowly loosening her up a bit. Eventually I slipped myself out of my boxers and thrust into her. She was all smiles, but as soon as I pushed into her she grabbed the sheets and got loud. It took way less effort to loosen her up than the previous night, and before long she was moaning up a storm. After a while we both came and collapsed back against each other in bed. We&amp;#39;d only been doing missionary so far, but it was already becoming so easy and fun. Even after only one night I could feel how compatible we were. Things just fit together the right way, there is no other way to describe it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After just basking in each other&amp;#39;s glory for a little while, I looked at the clock and it was 7:30am. I figured it was time for us to untangle ourselves from each other and get the day started so that we were &amp;quot;decent&amp;quot; when my Mom got home. Ashley rolled back over and pulled the covers up over her. I jumped out of bed and hunted down my boxers before kissing Ashley quick and heading for the door. I flung the door open and took a step into the hallway... and I felt my stomach drop into my feet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Coffee. Coffee was all I smelled. My brain was still bogged down with images of Ashley naked and fuzz from a long night of sex and sleep, so I didn&amp;#39;t put 2 and 2 together right away. &amp;#39;Why does it smell like coffee?&amp;#39; Perhaps because someone had made some? Jesus fucking christ. I walked down the hall and peaked in across the living room to the kitchen. Sitting at the kitchen table, with the coffee maker going in the background, was my older sister.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I ducked back down the hallway again. &amp;#39;Holy shit. How long had she been there? She DEFINITELY wasn&amp;#39;t there the night before.&amp;#39; Then it dawned on me: it didn&amp;#39;t matter how long she had been there. If she had been there longer than even 15 minutes, she heard EVERYTHING that just happened in that house. Our house is a fucking LIBRARY when nobody is home. You can literally hear a fucking pin drop.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I scooted back down the hallway and into the bathroom, which was going to be my original destination. As I attempted to pee (which took a minute because I had just gotten done FUCKING ASHLEY), I was simultaneously shitting my pants. And I didn&amp;#39;t even have pants on. And yes, these jokes are just a product of how much I am, even right now as I am writing this, still shitting my pants. I have a habit of diffusing awkward or shitty situations with humor, so sue me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What the hell can you even do in that situation? I jumped in the shower, unsure of what to do besides wash the sex off me while trying to think of what to say. If she had been there that morning, my older sis (&amp;quot;Sarah&amp;quot;) DEFINITELY heard EVERYTHING. I could only hope that by some miracle she had arrived afterwards or hadn&amp;#39;t heard. The craziest part about it is that she lives far away (at least 4 hour drive, usually 5 the way she drives). And she never just comes for a visit for the heck of it. She literally never just &amp;quot;drops in&amp;quot;. It&amp;#39;s always a planned visit, with her girlfriend and kids, for a whole weekend at least.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got out of the shower after just a few minutes and went down to my room to throw shorts and a shirt on. I didn&amp;#39;t think there was anything else to do other than just go say hi to Sarah and hope for the best. I made my way down the hall and into the living room. As I approached the kitchen, I faked some surprise in my voice the best I could.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;Whoa! Hey! What are you doing here? Mom didn&amp;#39;t say anything about you coming by!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sarah:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;Hey how&amp;#39;s it going?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She smiled weakly, and stood up. We hugged quick, and she sat back down.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;Good. Really good. I&amp;#39;m assuming you know I&amp;#39;m moving to (new town) soon?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sarah:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ll say, it sounded like things were going &amp;#39;really good&amp;#39; for you back there!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She smiled much bigger this time, like she had said something hilarious, completely avoiding my attempt at deflection. But what a terrible feeling that was. I assumed she knew. Fuck me, she knew and I was about to spiral off into a vortex of shit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;Uhh... did you hear anyth-&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sarah:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;How could I not?! I know it isn&amp;#39;t (ex-girlfriend) anymore, so who is it? Anyone I know?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#39;Holy fuck, ok... So she hadn&amp;#39;t put it together yet.&amp;#39; I thought to myself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;Hahaha, oh... nobody you know. She&amp;#39;s uh... not decent right now or I&amp;#39;d introduce you.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sarah:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;I bet, nothing sounded decent about what was coming from that hallway before. Does Mom know about this? You know back in the day I would always get in trouble if I had someone over the house when she wasn&amp;#39;t home!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By that point my imaginary pants were dragging on the ground from all the imaginary shit packed into them. How the fuck could I possibly play that off? &amp;#39;There is no fucking imaginary girl that can come out of my room right now&amp;#39;, I thought to myself. I had dug myself a hole that I was standing in the middle of as it was filling with liquid shit for me to drown in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And, like clockwork, that&amp;#39;s when Ashley walked in. And she walked in not expecting Sarah to be there (obviously). And by that I mean, she walked in dressed only in the sexy white bra and panties she had been wearing the night before (which still looked great BTW).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I turned around, away from Sarah, as she walked into the room. Ashley just stopped for a second and stared at us. Sarah reacted first, exclaiming, &amp;quot;Jesus girl, put some clothes on!&amp;quot;. Ashley didn&amp;#39;t move at first. She was just frozen. Not waiting for her to react, I immediately turned away from her and yelled, &amp;quot;Fuck Ash, seriously!&amp;quot;. She finally got the hint, yelling &amp;quot;Ahh!!&amp;quot; before spinning around and running back to her room, slamming the door at the end of the hallway.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I laughed nervously, since it was even worse that Sarah knew Ashley was home as well. It was definitely my fault too, since I should have gone back and warned Ashley that Sarah was there. But I figured she had gone back to sleep. Yes, I&amp;#39;m an idiot.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sarah:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;What the actual fuck, you guys just walk around here naked now since I moved out?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I couldn&amp;#39;t actually tell if she was joking or not because of how loudly &amp;#39;The End of the World As We Know It&amp;#39; was playing inside my head.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;No, that was all new for me too.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After I said that I could only think about all the stories I had read before I had even confronted Ashley about her getting into the shower with me that day. So many of the &amp;quot;disaster&amp;quot; stories and the other stuff I had read about when relationships like I had with Ashley went poorly were because of lies and them being uncovered. It&amp;#39;s literally the one thing I wanted to avoid: lying to people directly about me and Ashley. It hadn&amp;#39;t even been 4 weeks and there I was, fresh off my first real sex with Ashley, lying to my older sister about everything.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sarah:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;Pretty fancy getup she had on too. I don&amp;#39;t think I even own anything that sexy. I should ask her where she got it!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;I was too busy averting my eyes to notice!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sarah:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;Haha, I bet.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I laughed nervously, unsure what to do. I kinda looked back toward the hallway, wondering if there was some way to get out of that situation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;So... what are you doing here? Mom didn&amp;#39;t mention you coming down. She won&amp;#39;t be home for another couple hours at least. She had her reunion yesterday.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sarah:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;Yeah I spoke with her last night. She was in rare form, pretty drunk on the phone with me. She told me to come down if I had time today. She wants to take us all out to eat tonight. Have everyone together before you move out. Ashley is going to be leaving her now too, so I think she is just feeling a little conscious of that.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;Mom&amp;#39;s got empty nest syndrome already, huh?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sarah:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;Yeah, definitely. You guys are moving far too! Almost as far as I am, and in the opposite direction!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We kept chatting a little more. My sister actually made me think a little about my Mom and how we were leaving her alone. Made me feel kinda bad about everything. My Dad had left her, then Sarah, and now she was going to be losing me and Ashley too. We&amp;#39;re all gonna have to make an effort to see her more after we move out. But regardless, I was happy to be off the topic of what had just happened. After a while Sarah looked toward the bedroom hallway.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sarah:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;So is your girlfriend sleeping back there? You planning to have her come to dinner with us?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;No, definitely not. It should just be the four of us. Speaking of which, (Sarah&amp;#39;s Girlfriend) isn&amp;#39;t coming?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sarah:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;No, she had to work today.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;Ok... well let me go see what is going on back there...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got up and walked away, glancing back to give Sarah a quick smile as she watched me walk away. As soon as I was out of sight, I opened the door to my room and then closed it again without entering before tip-toeing down to my sister&amp;#39;s room. I quietly opened the door and stuck my head in. Ashley was in her bed curled up in a little ball. She hadn&amp;#39;t gotten dressed. I walked over to her and she rolled over. She had been crying, since her eyes were all red and puffy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ashley:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;whispering&lt;/em&gt; &amp;quot;Oh my god, we&amp;#39;re fucked right? Tell me we&amp;#39;re not fucked right now... oh my god... I&amp;#39;m such an idiot... &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She was obviously shitting her pants just as much as I was.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;No, but she did hear us before-&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ashley:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;Ohhh jesus fuck-&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;-she thinks I have a girl in my room. Ash, listen to me. You need to calm your shit down, get dressed, and then get Sarah OUT of there. I can just say my &amp;#39;girlfriend&amp;#39; left before she got a chance to introduce herself, and it&amp;#39;ll be fine.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ashley shook her head ok and started getting up. Really I was trying to convince myself that everything would be fine just as much as I was her. I hustled over to the door and whipped it open so I could head back to my room. Unfortunately, of course, Sarah was already in the hallway only a few steps from Ashley&amp;#39;s door. I walked out and closed the door behind me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sarah:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;... she change yet?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;Hahaha, not yet.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sarah:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;Why the hell did she let you in there then?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sarah laughed, but kinda halfheartedly. I am NOT good at lying.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;Great question. Going to check on my girl. Be right back.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hot footed it down to my room, walked in and closed the door. I heard Sarah knock on Ashley&amp;#39;s door and Ashley tell her to come in. I could hear indistinct mumbling coming from them as I sat on my bed. I waited 5 minutes (that&amp;#39;s enough time to have seen if my &amp;quot;girlfriend&amp;quot; was awake yet right?) before coming back out. Sarah was still in Ashley&amp;#39;s room so I walked to the kitchen and got a cup of coffee before sitting at the kitchen table. My heart was still racing as I hoped for some kind of miracle to happen. Another 5 minutes had gone by and Sarah still hadn&amp;#39;t come out of Ashley&amp;#39;s room. I went back to my room and rummaged around a bit. Another 5 minutes. The fuck were they doing in there? I took the opportunity to make my move. I ran to the front hall and opened and closed the door loudly and then scurried back into the kitchen to my coffee and sat back down.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;GGGOOOAAALLL!!!!! I was so relieved. I could only hope that was enough to convince Sarah that someone had just left the house. Another few minutes went by and eventually Ashley and Sarah came back out to the kitchen. I told Sarah that my girlfriend had actually overslept so she had to go real quickly. The &amp;quot;devil is in the details&amp;quot; though, right?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sarah:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;Wait how the hell did she leave? Did she park on the street too?&amp;quot; (that explains why Sarah&amp;#39;s car hadn&amp;#39;t been in the driveway, she parked on the street out of view)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;... she called an Uber, she just hustled out of here.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sarah:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;Weird...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I changed the topic, saying I&amp;#39;d introduce her next time or if she was planning on staying longer than just that day. The rest of the day went on normally. My Mom got home with a huge hangover in the early afternoon. She took a nap while me, Sarah, and Ashley all hung out and watched TV and caught up. Sarah is actually a really awesome person, and not just because she&amp;#39;s family. She is a lot of fun to be around despite being a good deal older than us, but you&amp;#39;d never know it. She is a big kid. She&amp;#39;s gone through some pretty tough times and dealt with a lot of hate/ridicule because of her life choices and being gay, especially back when she was in school and stuff wasn&amp;#39;t as accepted as it is today, which thankfully made her a very outspoken and open person later in life rather than it going the other way. I have thought that Sarah would be the only one I&amp;#39;d think might understand what me and Ashley had decided to pursue, but that didn&amp;#39;t mean I wanted to test that theory.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So that evening was fine and we had a good time out as a family. Ashley and I were just normal brother and sister all night, and it was great having our family back together for a night out. Sarah decided that she wanted to go home that night so she&amp;#39;d have a Sunday to relax with her family before going back to work Monday. She gave me and Ashley little gifts for our new place (small little knickknacks to brighten up the living room area) before taking off. Ashley and I talked that night back at the house after Mom went to sleep, and we both agree that we were stupid for falling asleep together and not checking the house before having sex again the following morning. We chalked it up to a learning experience and vowed to never be that lackadaisical again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Later that night, when I was in my room playing some games alone, my phone buzzed. I checked it and it was a text from Sarah. It said:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sarah (&lt;em&gt;via text&lt;/em&gt;):&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;So I&amp;#39;m not sure why you would have lied to me, but I know that there was no Uber. Or girlfriend for that matter.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I sat up and stared at the phone for what seemed like an hour. My first impulse was to go show Ashley, but I decided against it. At least not until I had collected my thoughts and tried to come up with what to reply with. I didn&amp;#39;t reply, and a few more texts came in eventually:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sarah (&lt;em&gt;via text&lt;/em&gt;):&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;I could see outside the whole time. Didn&amp;#39;t see anyone walk out. Part of me thinks you didn&amp;#39;t even have anyone in your room, but I&amp;#39;m kinda confused as to what to even think if that was the case. Care to comment?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I never did reply. I had no idea what to say. Part of me feels like Sarah may know more than she is leading on. Lying to her more and her knowing I am lying would just dig my hole deeper. I never expected to have to be dealing with a situation like this before we moved out of my fucking Mom&amp;#39;s house, but here I am. It&amp;#39;s not like she walked in on us, and I have no idea what she heard, if anything, or what she is thinking was going on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was hoping writing this all out would help me clear my head and figure out what the do, but it really hasn&amp;#39;t. If anyone has some advice for dealing with a situation like this, I&amp;#39;m all ears (or eyes I guess). Is there anyway to come out of this without a complete shit show? I was just going to deny whatever she has in her head and hope for the best, but I have no idea if that&amp;#39;s the right way to go. I really need to reply to her soon though (preferably in the next 24-48 hours) since it&amp;#39;s been a couple days since she texted me. She hasn&amp;#39;t sent any other messages since then, but she probably thinks it&amp;#39;s weird I haven&amp;#39;t replied already.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks in advance for any advice!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

And now you both decide you need to move across the state, by some strange coincidence, to the same town?  Not saying any of this is obvious, but if your mom has above average observation and/or deduction skills she would have some inkling.  At least enough to call your older sister and start spitballing.  \n\nNo need to panic though.  If she's that good at reading you two, she probably realizes its a relatively innocent puppy love kind of situation and doesn't want to ruin your life over it.  She'll probably wait for Sarah to have the talk with you before she says anything at all.  Not that there's any need for you to rush that.  She made the first overture over text but she probably didn't expect a reply, at least not anything of substance.  She'll have the full conversation with you when she's good and ready.  You know her and we don't; so you'll have to figure out what you can say to convince her to give you her blessing when that time comes.  Best of luck.",

Sarah didn\u2019t see anyone and likely deduced that you didn\u2019t have a girlfriend over. Your conversations with her probably made this even more obvious. She knows Ashley and you are moving in together quite a bit far from home. Finally, she might have noticed some nervousness from you two on that day. So after all this suspicious behavior, it really isn\u2019t going to be that hard for Sarah to conclude that it was you and Ashley that she heard. \n\nHere\u2019s my advice: \nI don\u2019t think Sarah is stupid. You and Ashley should come clean to Sarah. She most likely suspects that you two are together somehow.\n\nIf you\u2019re really convinced that Sarah won\u2019t do anything to hurt you two, you should talk to her about it. If you do want to talk to Sarah about it (you don\u2019t have to), you and Ashley should do it in person. You need to make sure she understands that no one is being taken advantage of. Also, just answer to the best of your abilities anything she asks.\n\nIf you\u2019re not going to tell her anything, just try not to be suspicious when you and Ashley are around other family members. If she keeps asking about that incident, just stick to your original answer and try to answer about when your girlfriend left. Also, say that you forgot about replying to her text. If she asks about meeting your girlfriend you\u2019re going to have to come up with something.\n\nGood luck. I hope you and Ashley get over this incident without any severe repercussions.",

Your sister, well, she is just your sister, I dont think she wants to lose either of you over spilling the beans. But she probably just wants to understand. Your all adults now, and kids (siblings) that are now adults, understand that life is free will, we are free to make our own choices. She may scold you a little, but she isnt going to disown you.

If she was playful enough to make a jokey comment with you about who it was, she would have been curious enough to get close enough to snoop. \n\n  She spent all that time with Ash in her room as you tried to figure out what to do. As someone else pointed out, the smell of sex was probably in the room. Also, sisters can read each other. If Ash spent enough time alone in her room with her while you tried to figure out your girl in your room problem and she was that scared and had just been crying, no way Sarah doesn't figure that out. \n\nEspecially if she knew Ash had a crush on you while she was growing up. No way she would have been able to hide it that long from her own sister. She may have thought she was clever, cute, private about it. But all those clues Ash told you she gave you over the years? Yeah, Sarah saw at least some of those. My feeling is that she knew about Ash having a crush on you for years but never thought anything would come of it probably. But now that she saw it first hand, it's not that shocking to her as she's already spent years thinking about the concept. \n\nAfter she knows you lied to her about your girl and Uber, she still spent time with you and everything seemed normal. You laughed together, everyone was cool. If she knew and had a problem with it, she'd have been tense. No way you find out your brother and sister are sleeping together one minute and then just act like everything is normal the next if you have a huge problem with the concept of incest. \n\nPersonally, I think here's how you should handle it. Give her back an answer that doesn't explicitly give the answer but will encourage her to let it out like you THINK she knows. Something you can wiggle out of perhaps if she comes back with an answer that seems like she really doesn't know. \n\nText her...I'm not going to treat you like you're stupid. I think you know what was going on. I just have been trying to think of a way to talk about it with you because it's such a sensitive subject. \n\nTest the waters. If she spills that she knows it was you and Ash, you'll know you're busted but it still seems like you were trying to be straight with her. \n\n If she acts like she doesn't know, REALLY think of something sensitive it could be...a friend of your mom's who slipped out the window because you REALLY didn't want to get caught.  A friend of hers. An EX of hers. Something that would be a seriously sensitive thing if you were caught together. \n\n",
