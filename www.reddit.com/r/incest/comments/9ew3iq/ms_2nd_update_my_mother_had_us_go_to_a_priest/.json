                        "selftext": "As I said in my first post we are broke and my mom's parents are catholic so she said a priest was kind of like a therapist or close enough. Thought it was kind of stupid, but my mother really feels guilty and nothing I had said seems to help. \n\nShe wanted me to go because I \"needed to understand why this was wrong\". However I already get why society thinks incest is wrong, it's just I don't really care about how gross or sickly the subject makes people feel. But I agreed to go anyways because I didn't want to make her even more upset than she already was.\n\nOnce there my mother started to explain what happened. Because I never met this person before I kept quiet as it's always very uncomfortable for me to deal with strangers in person. She left out the fact we had sex a number of times and just told him it only happened the one time while we were drunk. \n\nHe then got angry with me and said men are always responsible for sex. I didn't get why this was my fault, but didn't say much as he told me about hell and told me I committed a horrible sin. Finally I snapped at the guy and asked him how this was my fault if she took me to the bedroom, she took my shorts off, she pushed me over and after she stripped she turned off the lights. Then while having sex, between how dark it was and how drunk I was everything seemed like a blissful burr. \n\nHe told me to quit making excuses and that wouldn't have happened if I had not taken advantage of her being drunk. After a while of hearing him talk I started wondering if he was right about me being the one at fault for letting it happen. Seeing how upset my mother was though I apologized for letting myself do that with her while we both were intoxicated. \n\nLater on the priest asked if I was on medication. I told him that the 3 times doctors put me on anti-depression medication led to me being very unstable. He asked what I meant by that and I told him within 2 weeks of taking anti-depression medication for the first time in 3th grade I was cutting myself.\n\nTold him after that in 6th grade a doctor convinced my mother into getting me on anti-depressants for a 2nd time. After sinking into the deepest depression in my whole life I contemplated the taking of my own life. After two months of this I just couldn't take it any longer and left school early. Walked though the woods, streets and after an hour was home alone. Filled the bathtub with water, went to grab the toaster and then plugged it into the bathroom wall outlet. If the police didn't pull up in time and come in to grab me who knows how that would have turned out. \n\nThen told him about the 3rd time a doctor insisted on me being depressed in 10th grade. The doctor told my mom to put me on SSRI meds. In less than a month I was carrying a pocket knife on my person to cut myself with in the restroom. When that wasn't enough I had decided it was time for me to rest in peace. Tried to cut my neck open at home in my room, but I chickened out with my shaky hands and ended up in the hospital instead of bleeding out. \n \nI told the priest that I really do feel awful as I let my mother down too many times in my life. Didn't even learn to talk until 5, didn't just understand social cues like the rest, kept royally failing in school and made life hard for her with my sensitivity issues related to sound/touch/taste. And now I am responsible for losing my job and having sex with her. Wished more than anything I had managed to step up to the plate for my mother's sake as while I enjoyed sex very much she regrets what happened. Actually at this point I was crying my eye's out. \n\nThe priest then said even this could be forgiven while talking a lot more about god and tried to convert me. Then after hearing a whole lot more about sin, god and hell shit we left. Upon coming home I took comfort in how my mother seemed much more upbeat and had told me on the ride home she doesn't blame herself for what happened anymore.\n\nAfter settling down some my mother then asks me to rub her back. Going into the bedroom I agree to do this as she stretches onto the mattress. Turning to face me she then thanked me for helping her out. By the end of rubbing her back though, I was getting really horny. To the point my dick hurt because it got caught up in my pants while erecting. And it didn't help that the night before I didn't even masturbate due to how bad I felt hearing my mother tell me she felt guilty about us having sex.\n\nTruth be told what I did next was selfish, but I had kept my passion bottled up and really wanted to come out of my shell. So I climbed onto the bed resting next to her and told my mom that even before we had sex I wasn't planning on getting married or finding someone to have a long term sexual relationship with. This kind of caught her off guard and also made her ask why.\n\nWanted to forgo giving a reason as one of them was I only wanted causal sex and even thought about paying an escort to lose my v-card at some point. However what I did tell her was that I didn't like what I saw in every similar relationship around me. That it feels like a very predatory game that people exploit to their own gain and I can't possibly read others well enough to figure out if they loved me or not as a person. \n\nBesides all that I can't overcome my socially anxious nature. It's hardwired into my brain at a very severe level. The only way I can cope is by heavy handed detachment and the best I can do is fake enjoying myself in social settings for brief amounts of time. Most of the time I end up disengaging altogether in what my mother calls shutting down. Really though according to the doctors that first diagnosed me with Autism at age 2 toward the severe end of the spectrum. I shouldn't be talking or writing this post at all, but I was blessed or cursed with higher intelligence than expected despite the odds. \n\nMy mother tried to assure me not everyone is bad, but I told her that's not the point. It really runs much deeper than that. As she really has seen me at my worst and understands me like no other could. No one else could compare and emotionally I would be settling for much less if I choose someone other than her to be sexually intimate with. At some point I would grow to resent any partner that didn't meet my mothers standard and wouldn't ever feel secure with them. \n\nAfter waiting a moment my mother asked me why I insist on being so stubborn and hard headed about this. My response was telling her from what I've seen of the world, commitment is dead and if I want a emotional sexually intimate relationship there's no other outlet. Because I am very slow to getting attached emotionally to someone and even then physical affection is something that bothers me a lot unless it's my mother or aunt. \n\nThen my mother asked if I even have tried approaching a girl before. So I confessed that after turning 18 when my mom's ban on dating lifted, my slightly older female first cousin I grew up with tried setting me up with her friends. Actually my cousin did a whole lot more than I even told my mother about and after seeing me fail so many times my cousin told me I am what sex robots are going to be for because I act so much like a computer. \n\nOur conversation soon ended however and I ended up helping her cook dinner. I noticed my mother seemed more relaxed and while I was eating suddenly told me that she didn't want to see me sad. Didn't really know for sure what she meant until nightfall when coming back out of the shower found her half-naked panting sprawled across my bed.\n\nTo say this was a system shock would be hugely underselling the moment I laid eyes on my mother touching herself on my bed like a young horny college woman. Once she noticed me though her legs closed up tight and she apologized before confessing that once she realized I was an adult she found me highly attractive. Then she also told me that it's been a massive struggle within herself to tell me I needed to one day move out and find a wife like society wants a mother to tell their son.\n\nMy response was that I only cared about what she wanted and that I'm most happy being myself instead of conforming to social expectations. As all my life I have been relentlessly bullied, ostracized, alienated and insulted for standing out. That I have been called every name in the book 100's of times. All society offers me is pain, humiliation and suffering. The world and society has rejected me so many times that I no longer care or feel punished for not fitting in. So now why should I give a damn about conforming to society when I was never wanted by the world in the first place. \n\nTelling her all of that made my mother upset as she got up and hugged me. While holding her she apologized for what I went though. Then she said I was making letting go of me as my mother for the happy life I'm supposed to have hard on her. So I joked, that if I got \u201cthe happy life\u201d married with kids my wife would leave me for a richer guy, take the kids, I would lose my job in some market depression and then I would spend my life in jail for being a deadbeat that can't pay child support.\n\nSaying that angered my mom and she asked why I had to be so negatively stubborn about it. Finally told my mom it's simply because I can't trust anyone but her to have an emotionally sexual relationship with. Then I went to sit on the bed and told her I didn't want to have an argument about this with her now. \n\nWe ended up cuddling on the bed after I apologized for being kind of a jerk about my reasoning. Thought she was going to leave, but then she told me that her worst nightmare is losing me. Didn't really know what else to say other than I love her. Later on she turned off the light and told me we would sleep together tonight. Before I even asked about sex she grabbed my dick and said that maybe being together this way was meant to be. \n\nThis turned me on 0-100 right away and despite wanting to ask questions I got on top of her. Before long I was humping her leg and she actually seemed into it. After a few minutes of foreplay with her breast I stuck my rock hard on deep inside her. Getting really into it is when I asked if rougher sex was okay. That's when something really woke up inside her because she told me impatiently \u201cfuck yes\u201d.  \n\nThought about when she was going to start moaning my name and so I told her to cry out my middle name instead of my first name. Did this because my mother used her fathers first name for my middle name and thought it would be kind of kinky. Just oh my fucking GOD she loved it and both of us lost our minds as right before I came she actually gasped &amp; called me daddy. \n\nSpent nearly an hour having mind blowing sex together before settling back down. Then she held my head in her arms until I fell asleep. To my very pleasant surprise, I woke up the next day to her riding my morning wood.\n\nAsked her while eating breakfast what changed her mind and my mother said she didn't want to see me hurt by some other woman or deny what she actually wants for the sake of what others mistakenly believe is best. We talked about mostly normal things after that and then went to the park together later that day.\n\nAll I have to say is; this is heaven, bliss and the jackpot all rolled into one lucky charmed sandwich. We have talked more about how this should work and agreed we want the sexual part of our relationship to be long term, but we know the sex won't last forever. So when that happens she will still be my wonderful mother. We decided to talk about what I want do with my sex life once she becomes disinterested with age and she told me to do whatever floats my boat. ",

We talked about mostly normal things after that and then went to the park together later that day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All I have to say is; this is heaven, bliss and the jackpot all rolled into one lucky charmed sandwich. We have talked more about how this should work and agreed we want the sexual part of our relationship to be long term, but we know the sex won&amp;#39;t last forever. So when that happens she will still be my wonderful mother. We decided to talk about what I want do with my sex life once she becomes disinterested with age and she told me to do whatever floats my boat. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

So while I counted as having high functioning autism there were many underlying gaps that impaired me day to day.  \n\nAs for your suggestion for therapy, my experiences with psychiatrist haven't really ever helped me much. While in public school they have asked my mother how I even function out in public due to how much anxiety I had. Because for me even being a room full of people not interacting with me was enough to induce almost suffocating levels of anxiety and I had to find ways to cope with that on my own. Really each day I loved nothing more than coming home simply to get away from being around so many people.  \n\nThat aside it takes a very long time for me to get comfortable enough with someone to actually want to socially interact with them. And after getting out of high school I find myself hating socializing more than before. Really don't see changing my mind about trusting someone other than mom to have a sexual relationship with. Know that's considered a negative attitude, but after getting fired it's only become even more clear to me that it's safer just not to date other people.  \n\nThank you for your input though, I appreciate it and hope you get what your looking for in life.

I\u2019ve also gone through severe depression at childhood and lesser episodes throughout my young life. I am in the higher end of the spectrum, but hearing about your severity and your intelligence was quite shocking, a rare combination indeed. I too have had similar views on society and relationships in the past. My mentality was that I didn\u2019t want to fall in love with someone or have sex. But for many years I have accepted that I really do want to fall in love and have a wonderful sex life. I also know what it\u2019s like to be so socially anxious that the only you can function is to become indifferent. I always believed that I\u2019d rather be alone than to act like someone I wasn\u2019t, even as a kid. I still have difficulty connecting to people because it takes a long time to get comfortable and when I do connect it\u2019s sometimes by accident. I rarely find people interesting and when I do I\u2019m too hesitant to act on it. I still haven\u2019t met someone I love or even approached a girl. \n\nBut I\u2019ve gotten better. I have learned to actually enjoy socializing more. I still avoid and sometimes think it\u2019s still bothersome but not as much. I don\u2019t have a distorted view on society and romance anymore. And despite my passivity, I know that there is someone(s) out there that I could love and trust completely. I am glad you could have such a relationship with your mother but I want you to know that she isn\u2019t the only one you could have such a relationship with. However, that doesn\u2019t mean you should look for someone else, just that you should have a more positive attitude. \n\nAlso, I hope you would consider cognitive behavioral therapy. I know you said that you\u2019re household is broke, but so is mine and we go to the psychiatrist regularly (it\u2019s covered by insurance though).  Maybe vocational therapy as well. ",
