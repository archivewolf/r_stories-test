She wasn't around and didn't answer my calls or texts for like 2 hours, and just said she'll be home late. When she finally got home at like 10, all she said was she needed time before she could talk about \"What happened\", and just went to her room. Yesterday was a little more normal, she still wasn't ready to talk and I didn't push for it, but she could be around me a little.\n\nToday we finally talked. \n\nI told her how I felt, that I've always been attracted to her, how much I love her, how much I've been hurting from the breakup and how incredible that night was. \n\nShe told me that she loves me and wants to help me get through this, but we should not have had sex. She's extremely guilty because hasn't been with anyone but my dad in over 25 years. \n\nI got some notes that this wasn't all she felt about it though. She said \"This was a terrible thing, not the sex, but what we did\", so she enjoyed it. She didn't really comment on my attraction to her either. And she didn't seem to be upset that she slept with her son, just that it was someone other than her husband. \n\nI feel awful that I caused infidelity in my parents marriage. Should I talk to my dad? Should my mom talk to him? Should we talk to him together? Would it be better to just try and forget this (even though I really don't want to)? My dad is coming home tonight, so I'm freaking out",
