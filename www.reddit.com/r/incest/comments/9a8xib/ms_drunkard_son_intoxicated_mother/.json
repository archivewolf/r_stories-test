I've moved out of my house, and my Husband filled for divorce. I have a horrible relationship with my son.\n\nOn my last post, my son kind of forced himself on me. And while I partially enjoyed it, it felt horrible. He had smacked me while forcing his penis into my mouth. He had walked away not caring at all. I felt so vulnerable and hurt and partially turned on that I felt like I was losing my mind.\n\nI went to shower afterwards and cried my eyes out. I could barley breath. I felt like I was having a heart attack. I didn't feel safe at home. I had locked the basement door and was terrified in my room. I packed a to go bag, called up my best friend, and asked her to pick me up. I tried to sound fine over the phone, but she knew something was wrong. When she arrived I quickly hurried out of the house to her car. I hugged her right away and told her to take me away. \n\nShe kept asking me whether everything was ok and seemed really worried. It made me feel bad, but I just needed to get away. My phone rang. It was him, my son, whom I didn't feel anything for at the moment when I saw his message. And my phone kept making noise, message after message.  \n\"Did you like it, bitch?\"  \n\"Guess where I'm at?\" with a picture attached. Him laying on a bed. I was lost to the meaning.  \n\"You know you want it,\" and another picture of his penis on my pillow.  \n\"How about I leave you a little gift?\"  A video of him masturbating with my underwear onto my pillow.  \nI felt disgusted. What the hell is happening to me? Why is behaving this way.\n\nI stayed with a my best friend and wanted to tell her everything but I couldn't get myself to confess. I don't want him to get into trouble. I called my husband and lied, \"Jenny, needs me, so I'll stay at her place tonight. Love you.\"  \nHe was really nice. \"Have fun. I miss you already.\"\n\nMy phone kept making noise and it was my son who kept steadily sending me messages. I stopped looking after a while and tried to relax. I felt horrible as the moment of him forcing himself on me kept going over and over in my mind. I didn't want it, but I enjoyed it a lot. I felt so disgusted with myself that I couldn't put it into words. My friend gave me some sort of pills to fall asleep. It helped a lot, but made me feel numb. \n\nWhen I woke up, I didn't go to work, but rather decided to tell my husband everything. Things have gone to far.\n\nI took an uber home, but asked him to drop me off half a block away. I was nervous. I slowly walked home trying to see whether I can see anyone. I didn't, so I walked in. My husband was there and I had this sigh of relief, like a weight lifted of my shoulders, the fear dissipating. We hung out. The entire time I couldn't hear what he was saying because I was thinking of a way to tell him what was going on. My heart was beating so loud, that my ears hurt.\n\nHe wanted a nice evening out together. And I said yes. The day passed by like it was nothing, and as we were getting dressed the words fell from my mouth. I looked at him. He was by the bed, putting on his tie, and I was in a bra and panties, trying on a dress. It didn't fit.  \n\"I think I'm in love with our son. I don't know how it happened, but after yesterday, I'm very uncomfortable being alone with him.\" I didn't make any sense. I was having an inner dialogue out loud. He just looked at me, lost.   \n\"What are you going on about?\"  \n\"He showed me his dick and I sucked it. And I liked it.\" I was in awe of what I was saying. Not scarred. I felt deaf to my own words. I couldn't control what I was saying.  \nHis face changed. I could see the lines appearing. A thick wad of meat forms between his eyebrows when he's angry. It swelled. He was quiet. Until he asked, \"What in the Fuck did you just say to me?\"  \n\"I'm in love with our son. I don't know what's wrong with me.\"  \n\n\nHe stomped towards me. I got lightly scared. \"I said, What the fuck are you saying?\" He kept on repeating it. He grabbed me by the sides of my arms. \"Look at me woman.\" I couldn't maintain eye contact. I had no idea what I was doing. Why wasn't I elaborating things better. My mind felt like it was inside a hurricane. I couldn't get any piece of information out.  \nThere was an eerie silence between us. He stumbled backwards onto our bed. Put his head down into his hands and just stayed quiet. I couldn't move. Finally, a noise from upstairs, the door opened and closed. Ben spoke out, \"Yo, I'm home.\"  \nThen my husband looked up. His face looked demonic. Scary. He softly spoke, \"Get over here,\" but I didn't budge.  \n\"Don't make me repeat myself,\" he continued with a soft voice, but angry demeanor.  \n\"Bend over on this bed right now and lift up your dress,\" I don't know why, but I didn't retort. I did as told. He spoke louder, \"Spread your cheeks, whore.\" I spoke up, \"Ben can hear us.\"  \nHe reached into one of our drawers and got something. He pulled down his pants, grabbed the back of my head and said to me, \"Say his name.\"  \nI didn't know what he was talking about. I heard Ben again, \"Hey, are you guys home?\" clearly leaning in to our room. He cant see us, but we can see his shadow through the lighting upstairs. I'm bent over, my head in the bed, and my hands spreading myself for my husband. I felt uncomfortable and scared. Then he started inserting himself inside me, but not where we normally do it. He put it into my butt. It hurt. He leaned over my back, next to my ear, \"I said, say his name, my love.\"  \nI gently said, \"Ben?\"  \nhe said, \"Louder,\" and kept pushing in slowly. It still kinda hurt.  \nI said it a breath louder, \"Ben.\"  \nHe went all the way in, \"So he can hear you!\" and started ramming me. I started getting louder and louder, \"Ben,\" over and over. I didn't want to say it. And, I, at no point protested. Instead, I started touching myself as my husband kept pounding me. It is not something we do often at all, anal sex, nor is it something I enjoy much, but I did this time. I hate myself so much as I write this. As he kept going I ended up orgasming. And he did too inside me. As he finished, he pulled out. It was quiet for a second then, he spit on me. He fucking spit on me. His last words were to me were, \"don't move.\" I heard his zipper clicking each of the steps up his trousers. His pants were up and he walked upstairs. I heard the door to our house open and shut.\n\nI cried. He walked out of the house that day and I haven't seen him since. I called and messaged him numerous times. Nothing. I don't know where he is. My son is another story. I don't feel like sharing at the moment. ",

We can feel sexually attracted but that does not equate to love.  It merely demonstrates lust.  The inner turmoil you are going through is understandable, but you were in an abusive relationship with your son.  He does not respect you.  He may not even love you.  And a husband behaving that way in response to your revelation really says a lot about him.  He basically sexually assaulted you, especially since you admitted to not particularly liking anal.  So he was punishing you with violent sex.  You need space from both of them.  They are harmful to you.  And if your husband behaves that way, maybe you need to be distant from him.  Divorce may not be bad.  At least, you can have some time for yourself to get some needed help.",

You are sexually aroused by him, but the relationship you described is abusive and your body\u2019s reaction does not make it right.  Sometimes, our body betrays us.  We can feel sexually attracted but that does not equate to love.  It merely demonstrates lust.  The inner turmoil you are going through is understandable, but you were in an abusive relationship with your son.  He does not respect you.  He may not even love you.  And a husband behaving that way in response to your revelation really says a lot about him.  He basically sexually assaulted you, especially since you admitted to not particularly liking anal.  So he was punishing you with violent sex.  You need space from both of them.  They are harmful to you.  And if your husband behaves that way, maybe you need to be distant from him.  Divorce may not be bad.  At least, you can have some time for yourself to get some needed help.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
