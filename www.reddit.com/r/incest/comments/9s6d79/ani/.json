We have an amazing and passionate sex life that is at times very adventurous. We've had a couple of \"unicorn\" experiences and have talked about many other potential experiments. I'm an insecure person overall, but my security in the solidity of our relationship is very strong. On to the meat of the situation... My sister is 42 and had children young. Her son is only a year younger than my bf and her daughter is 19. The last time they stayed at our house for a visit it was difficult not to notice how my niece's eyes followed my boyfriend's every move. At one point my bf had to admit, rather uncomfortably that he had also noticed her; i can't really blame him, she is quite attractive and her ass is amazing. On occasion since we've talked, jokingly at first, about how much fun we could have sharing her. She is off legal age, would likely be onboard while at the same time she has a very innocent air about her that would really increase the very taboo feeling of the interaction. She is coming for a visit next week.... Alone. There will be at least one night during the visit where it will be only my boyfriend, myself and her in the house. Should we attempt to act on the fantasy and if so, any advice on how to test the waters without mucking things up?",
