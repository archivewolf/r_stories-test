I wasn't allowed to talk to anyone. I wasn't allowed to cum myself. It started after a few times when I first started sucking on my son's cock.\n\nSucking on my son's cock reminds me a lot of sucking on his father's. I was told not to make him cum, that I would be in trouble if I did, that I'd lose my privileges. Well, one, feels like forever ago now, my son came home and went straight for the shower. I had just taken a bath and didn't want him to be mad there wasn't enough warm water for him, so I did what any mommy would do, I went in to apologize to him. He said something silly like, \"There's no need to say sorry, but there's a need to suck this cock.\" He had it out already. But he pulled the shower curtain all the way open and presented himself to me.\n\nI got on my knees. His cock was already hard and glistening. Seeing an already hard cock gets me going instantly, it revs up my body and shuts down my mind. The water was blasting, I was on the outside of the shower just on the floofy shower mat, and he was in the shower. He didn't fuck my face right away. He let me give it to him. But he still had his shower. He washed his hair with shampoo. He didn't ask me to keep going during it, but I did. The water soaked me. My hair was matted and drenched. It was running down my neck and under across my breasts. I rubbed myself, and even though I'm not allowed to unless I'm told, he didn't tell me to stop, so it was bad, I was breaking rules with him, but he was letting me.\n\nIt was hot to have water pool up around my knees outside of the shower. He even took a break to clean off his cock for me. That was after he had everything else clean, and his cock newly cleaned for me, that was when he face fucked me. He pulled my face forward and thrust my throat onto his cock. I've gotten better at not choking, but it's still always hard at first, like the muscles have to remember how much I want it and learn to relax. He gripped my wet hair and made me gasp for my breaths. Eventually I did something I was never supposed to do.\n\nI made him cum. The water was cold at that point. His hot cum in my mouth tasted so good. He pulled out and shot a few streams on my face, which were warm and welcome. He gave out one long, \"Fuuuuuuuck.\" He slapped his cock on my forehead, slid it down my face. Then he pinched my cheeks together and said, \"Don't say a word.\" I was shaking. He dried off and left. I looked in the mirror with the cum on my face and decided I would never tell anyone about this. But, here I am. And I'm going to be in more trouble than ever.\n\nIt wasn't the only time he came for me. I've been eating his cum for a while now. I know there's something wrong with me, but I can't stop. I've been tempted to slip some of his semen into my pussy. To see what it feels like. Ok, honestly, to see how far I can tempt the devil. My ultimate fantasy has been sex with my son. But more than that, I want him to cum inside me. I'm obsessed with it. But I don't want to beg him to. I want him to take it from me. Like his father did. I had my son while I was so young, and I've always wondered what it would have been like to have another child. I imagine it a lot. Please don't judge me. I feel so bad about it. \n\nIt's been a crazy year. I won't go all the way into it. I don't know if anyone cares about me anymore, or what I'm even worth anymore. I feel pretty vulnerable sexually. I'm always looking for someone to take control of me, and so far it's only been a couple people who have been able to. Most of you are too tame toward me. I'm much weaker than you think. I'm not saying I want you to prey on me. I don't know what I'm saying. I've earned this update over the past year. But I may get in trouble over what's in it. I appreciate all the support. I appreciate being told what to do even more. Maybe one day I'll sit on my son's cock and he'll have no choice but to explode inside me. I can't imagine. ",
