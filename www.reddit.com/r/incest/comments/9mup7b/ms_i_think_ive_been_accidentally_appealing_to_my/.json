I've made a throwaway account to talk about this because obviously.\n\nSo to provide the necessary background (if I miss anything feel free to ask); I work as a hypnotist, mostly doing therapeutic work but a few people I know have hired me as party entertainment, so I guess you could also call me a stage hypnotist if you wanted. Anyway, I have two children, older is my son, younger is a daughter. I have a tendency to use my family for practice, so both of them, as well as my husband, have been put under by me many times.\n\nRecently when borrowing one of my son's devices for something, some recommended videos and such relating to hypnosis caught my eye and I wondered if he'd been looking into it himself (his sister has an interest in learning how to do it, but he never really has), a quick look through his history showed quite a few hypnosis-related videos, specifically femdom, making it seem fairly clear that it's less interest, and more fetish.\n\nSo now I'm thinking, what if my son gets turned on when I hypnotise him? I understand totally, my husband and I have used it to spice things up in the past, but it still raises some questions. If he did have any desire to realise these fantasies with me, I would honestly be fairly comfortable with that, I want him to enjoy himself and be safe and with me as his hypnotist, he's as safe as possible. Sexual taboos have never bothered me too much either, so I don't feel too much of a barrier to having that kind of relationship. Nonetheless, I still don't really know how to broach a subject like this, so I figured this would be the perfect place to ask.",
