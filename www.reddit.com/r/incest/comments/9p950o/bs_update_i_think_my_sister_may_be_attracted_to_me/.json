                        "selftext": "Hello /r/incest. A [very long time ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/incest/comments/2on5xt/bs_i_think_my_sister_may_be_attracted_to_me/) I posted about my attraction to my sister, and asked for advice from you guys after i gave her a pretty risqu\u00e9 foot massage - you were very helpful in putting things in perspective and it made me think a bunch about what i wanted from this. I'm writing an update because, after 3 years, something happened again.\n\nSo after my post, like (I think) most people in this situation, I pussied out and didn't pursue this. Life got in the way, Caroline moved out of our parents' place, i got a girlfriend soon after and I sort of dismissed my obsession with my big sister as me being lonely and her being around and attractive. Some of you might feel upset but hey, it's my life and trying anything might have ruined it, especially since i care about my family above anything else. It's not exactly easy to make the first move when there's such a taboo involved. So, sorry about the lack of updates but, well, basically nothing happened, I felt like nothing was worth telling. I did lurk here a lot though...\n\nBecause I definitely didn't forget her. Over those 3 years, I thought of my sister pretty damn often, i'd avoid even holding hands with my gf in the presence of my sister for example, not because she's family, but because it felt weird since I felt strongly attracted to her. I grew to realize, when she was away, that it wasn't just physical attraction. I longed for her presence, I wanted to hold her hand, to make her laugh, I wanted to caress her cheek and tell her what she meant to me. It was sexual too though - I grew a foot fetish basically from our past encounter alone, something which my girlfriend of two years always found gross when I mentioned it shyly, and so i ended up fantasizing about kissing my sister's feet constantly for a lot of this time.\n\nSo a quick summary of everything up to last week: \n\nAbout a year ago, my long-term partner and I broke it off after an almost two year long relationship, i've been with two women since then but nothing too serious. My sister was there for me as was everyone I knew, it wasn't an easy breakup, but I'm over it now. 5 months ago I got a better job than what I used to, and soon after I got an opportunity to rent a pretty good appartment near work, as long as I had someone else to share it with (for rent). Let's say it's in Townsville. I mentioned this to my friends, but most of them already had plans for this year, and it was looking like a no-go until mentioned it to Caroline, my sister.\n\nShe was thrilled, because she was just done with college and had some good job opportunities very near Townsville. Caroline and I agreed to plan for her moving in with me, I'd have to cover the costs by myself for a month because she still had a lease until September, but then she'd come in and live with me. I was excited, and not just because of my persistent attraction to my sister, but because i just love being around her generally, as a family member. She's always been here for me, and me for her, we have a great relationship that a lot of people we know are jealous of. I'd really give anything for her, and the prospect of living with her again (after she moved out of my parents') was really awesome. She's really fun and cool, and i've always looked up to her.\n\nSo her previous lease ran out and she moved in with me over a month ago. It's been fun, and we've started to get a rythm of spending at least one night of the week watching a movie or something together, in the living room, usually with pizza, with her sometimes resting her head on my lap, cuddling into me, or resting her feet in my lap... If you went back and read my previous post, I think you can understand which state doing this with Caroline did to me, it's made me relive my fantasies of massaging and kissing her body, it's made me wonder what would have been had I been bolder 3 years ago. I don't think she ever noticed my raging erections, at least i don't see any way she would have known, i made sure to keep her limbs away from my shaft out of fear.\n\nAfter a few weeks of this I started frequenting this subreddit more again, drawing inspiration from success stories, and that only fed into my fantasies more. 2 weeks ago i got so horny thinking of her, I snuck into her room while she was out and stole one of her panties, bringing it back to my room, My cock was harder than it had ever been just smelling her scent from it while touching myself, but after I came I felt so guilty, I felt like i was betraying my sister, and i didn't want to be doing this without knowing. I needed to know if she was attracted to me.\n\nI decided I'd do what i should have done years ago - try to caress and kiss her feet again, do what had worked, but push it further, see where it lead,but above all I wanted to talk about it with her after it had happened, not just let her run away. I decided that if it went wrong, if she rejected me, we were both adults and we could put it past us, I just couldn't live with the indecision anymore.\n\nTuesday, 2 days ago, we had another one of our movie nights. That time we settled on the latest Bojack horseman season, since we both like that show. Both my sister and I weren't that hungry so we left the question of food for later and instead went on to watch some eps, me sitting on the couch and her sitting sideways in it, her legs towards me. We drank some wine and chatted, we both like to talk about stuff while watching which ENRAGES some people we know. As we did that I was really tempted to caress her leg, but decided against it, the mood wasn't right. Instead we talked about life, as we often do when we're a bit tipsy, and she eventually relaxed back and extended her legs on my lap. That was my green light, my heart was absolutely pounding inside my chest as I slowly ran my hands on her ankles. I remember clearly how it happened, we were talking about her past relationship (A guy who seemed really nice who had ended up cheating on her) and I said something like \"Any guy who does that, he's the one who's missing out\" and smiled, slowly caressing her feet up and down.\n\nShe sighed and relaxed visibly and I started kneading into her soles as we kept talking, as if nothing was happening. I kept thinking, *\"there is no way she isn't remembering what happened back then\"*, that thought was floating around my head and driving me crazy. Did she just think kissing someone's feet was normal, and it wasn't a big deal? Did she actually forget? Or... was she waiting, anticipating, hoping I'd make the first move? I was torn, but i focused on the massage, realizing i'd grown more and more silent, and so had she, as the show filled the silence in the room.\n\nI finally decided to grow some balls, and still caressing her, i smiled and said, as casually as I humanly could: \"This reminds me of when I'd give you massages like this, at mom and dad's house\". My heart sank after I said this, I know it's not much for you guys,  but that was it, I had acknowledged what had happened years ago. There weren't multiple foot massages, there was this single one, the one that had been driving me absolutely nuts for so long. If she feigned ignorance - or had genuinely forgotten it - I could now safely retreat without ruining my relationship with my sister. Even in my wildest fantasies I had never dared to imagine the words that came out of her mouth then:\n\n\"I think i recall more mouth action, back then\", and her tone was playful as she said that. I'd heard the expression \"my heart skipped a beat\" before, but at that second i'm 100% sure my heart literally did not beat for a solid few seconds. My cheeks went HOT, and I struggled with a reply. I decided to play the teasing card, since that's what she was going for.\n\n\"You didn't seem to mind\", I replied, and finally i looked up into her eyes. Her look was hard to read, but her cheeks were visibly red - though that could have been from the wine, too. Before she could muster a response, I lifted her foot to my lips and kissed it playfully. She wiggled her toes a bit and responded \"Maybe we should eat if you're that hungry\", giggling a bit.\n\nI thought twice, here. That answer could have been an attempt to defuse the situation if she was uncomfortable. I understand some of you might be yelling at your screens reading this but you need to understand that above all I didn't want my sister to be uncomfortable, i wanted this to grow into something with her, whatever it was, this I had decided. So I put her foot down, still caressing it, and said \"If you mind, you should tell me\". She tried to reply but I cut her off, wanting to be clear, \"Because, well, *I* don't mind it\", and she removed her feet from my lap, sitting up, staring at me. At first i thought she would leave, but she said \"Go make food, then we'll talk\".\n\nI don't think i've ever made pasta that fast, I was so lost in thought, while she'd paused the ep and was on her phone. \"She wants to talk, I guess that's good?\" is the summation of my jumbled thoughts. *She didn't call me a creep!* I kept wanting to cry out, but I made the food and brought it to the table facing the couch along with plates and everything.\n\nOnce we were done, she said \"I want you to listen to what I have to say\", and she lifted a hand as I tried to speak up. \"Don't interrupt me, I've been thinking about what i'm about to tell you, I've twisted it and turned it and changed it around in my head, and i think you should hear the whole thing, don't interrupt\". I nodded and said nothing, I wanted to tell her that she was my sister and I loved her no matter what, but as she asked, I stayed silent as she begun.\n\nShe told me everything from her point of view, I can't relate it word for word but here's the gist of it. She said that back then she'd felt attracted to me, and she wanted to spend more time with me. She was fairly immature and emotionally unstable at the time, and that's why she'd tease my friend, hoping to get my attention. When that thing had happened three years ago, she'd decided it was her own sick mind, her instability, that had forced her to do that. She thought it was *100% her* who had instigated this, and she saw what had happened as basically molesting me, because i was her little brother.\n\nSo she'd decided to rush moving out, seeing as little of me as possible, to try and make herself forget, maybe also forgive herself. But she hadn't forgotten, and everytime she saw me she just wanted to kiss me. She said she felt sick, she had no one to tell these feelings to, and I probably thought she was a sicko now that she was saying it. I wanted to say she wasn't, but she had asked me to stay silent so I did.\n\nShe said that she'd debated long and hard whether she should move in with me like this, but she had decided to do it because once she had abstracted her attraction to me, she still would have moved in with me - which had also been my train of thought! I was mindblown, if only we had talked back then...\n\nOnce she was done, I told her my side of the story, as I've related it in the two posts on here, with some added minor stories i haven't included in here. Her eyes widened as I told it, and when we were done we both sort of stared at each other, unsure of what to do now. We both didn't really know where to go from here, there were no real social norms for this interaction, so I wondered what I would do if this weren't my sister, if it were a girl I loved and who loved me back, and I leaned in and kissed her cheek, saying \"I'm glad you're here now\".\n\nShe hugged me tight, and she started sobbing, saying that she'd felt like such a pervert, a weirdo, for all this time, having to hold it in, she'd had a few times where those family relationships had been brought up with friends and she'd had to pretend to laugh while she felt her stomach turn. I said I didn't know where we'd go from there, but whatever happened she's my sister, she's the one i care about the most in the world, and I started tearing up as I said that too.\n\nWe agreed to rest on it, but she leaned in and kissed my cheek before gong to bed and held it as we hugged tight. I could barely sleep that night, and odly enough my thoughts weren't sexual. I was thinking about the future, about what we should do, how to approach this tomorrow, if we really wanted a relationship... Anyway the cat was out of the bag and we both seemed relatively happy and stable which is most than i've seen in a lot of posts on here so I'm happy!\n\nI'll update if anything significant happens later, but i'd like to thank anyone reading this, getting it off my chest helped me a bunch. If the next update is in 3 years, well, I guess I'll see you then.",

At first i thought she would leave, but she said &amp;quot;Go make food, then we&amp;#39;ll talk&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t think i&amp;#39;ve ever made pasta that fast, I was so lost in thought, while she&amp;#39;d paused the ep and was on her phone. &amp;quot;She wants to talk, I guess that&amp;#39;s good?&amp;quot; is the summation of my jumbled thoughts. &lt;em&gt;She didn&amp;#39;t call me a creep!&lt;/em&gt; I kept wanting to cry out, but I made the food and brought it to the table facing the couch along with plates and everything.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once we were done, she said &amp;quot;I want you to listen to what I have to say&amp;quot;, and she lifted a hand as I tried to speak up. &amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t interrupt me, I&amp;#39;ve been thinking about what i&amp;#39;m about to tell you, I&amp;#39;ve twisted it and turned it and changed it around in my head, and i think you should hear the whole thing, don&amp;#39;t interrupt&amp;quot;. I nodded and said nothing, I wanted to tell her that she was my sister and I loved her no matter what, but as she asked, I stayed silent as she begun.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She told me everything from her point of view, I can&amp;#39;t relate it word for word but here&amp;#39;s the gist of it. She said that back then she&amp;#39;d felt attracted to me, and she wanted to spend more time with me. She was fairly immature and emotionally unstable at the time, and that&amp;#39;s why she&amp;#39;d tease my friend, hoping to get my attention. When that thing had happened three years ago, she&amp;#39;d decided it was her own sick mind, her instability, that had forced her to do that. She thought it was &lt;em&gt;100% her&lt;/em&gt; who had instigated this, and she saw what had happened as basically molesting me, because i was her little brother.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So she&amp;#39;d decided to rush moving out, seeing as little of me as possible, to try and make herself forget, maybe also forgive herself. But she hadn&amp;#39;t forgotten, and everytime she saw me she just wanted to kiss me. She said she felt sick, she had no one to tell these feelings to, and I probably thought she was a sicko now that she was saying it. I wanted to say she wasn&amp;#39;t, but she had asked me to stay silent so I did.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She said that she&amp;#39;d debated long and hard whether she should move in with me like this, but she had decided to do it because once she had abstracted her attraction to me, she still would have moved in with me - which had also been my train of thought! I was mindblown, if only we had talked back then...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once she was done, I told her my side of the story, as I&amp;#39;ve related it in the two posts on here, with some added minor stories i haven&amp;#39;t included in here. Her eyes widened as I told it, and when we were done we both sort of stared at each other, unsure of what to do now. We both didn&amp;#39;t really know where to go from here, there were no real social norms for this interaction, so I wondered what I would do if this weren&amp;#39;t my sister, if it were a girl I loved and who loved me back, and I leaned in and kissed her cheek, saying &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m glad you&amp;#39;re here now&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She hugged me tight, and she started sobbing, saying that she&amp;#39;d felt like such a pervert, a weirdo, for all this time, having to hold it in, she&amp;#39;d had a few times where those family relationships had been brought up with friends and she&amp;#39;d had to pretend to laugh while she felt her stomach turn. I said I didn&amp;#39;t know where we&amp;#39;d go from there, but whatever happened she&amp;#39;s my sister, she&amp;#39;s the one i care about the most in the world, and I started tearing up as I said that too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We agreed to rest on it, but she leaned in and kissed my cheek before gong to bed and held it as we hugged tight. I could barely sleep that night, and odly enough my thoughts weren&amp;#39;t sexual. I was thinking about the future, about what we should do, how to approach this tomorrow, if we really wanted a relationship... Anyway the cat was out of the bag and we both seemed relatively happy and stable which is most than i&amp;#39;ve seen in a lot of posts on here so I&amp;#39;m happy!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll update if anything significant happens later, but i&amp;#39;d like to thank anyone reading this, getting it off my chest helped me a bunch. If the next update is in 3 years, well, I guess I&amp;#39;ll see you then.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
