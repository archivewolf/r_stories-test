I have a cousin (female) who I snap with occasionally along with other people in my life. I was holding a conversation with her and a girl I was talking to and things got heated with the girl. She wanted to see something of mine and I wasn\u2019t against it. Thing is, when I sent the pic to the girl I also sent it to my cousin...\n\nI tried to cover my tracks by sending 20 pics from my camera roll (not exactly that much but you get what I\u2019m going for) and repeatedly pleading for her not to scroll up. Apparently she was curious about what was so bad for her not to scroll up (I mean I get it) and saw what I sent. She wasn\u2019t upset since she knew it was an accident and she told me how she almost did something similar in the past. We kept talking with the conversation growing more sexual in nature until she confessed that she liked the pic I accidentally sent her. I was a little shocked when she said that but we kept going with our \u201cbonding time\u201d and we even started sending each other what we would have sent to others for opinions. This eventually led to us talking about possibly trying things together if we ever had the opportunity.\n\nI\u2019m not gonna lie and say I haven\u2019t thought about her before, but I didn\u2019t want things to get too weird between us. Although another part said that it\u2019s already in that territory and that we\u2019d be fine overall. Well in the end I listened to that part.\n\nWe talked about things and decided that we would be down to doing sexual things if we were both available. Although actually seeing each other is the problem considering how far we are from one another currently. We\u2019ve been talking since our little incident and recently we were able to actually see one another. \nWe couldn\u2019t get too long of a time alone, since family was around, however we were able to steal a few moments with just the two of us.\n\nWe made small talk before I had to leave and she decided to go for a hug. She started to walk off slowly and I thought it\u2019d be one of the only times to try so I got her attention, and when she turned around I leaned in for the kiss. She returned it and we went at it for a brief moment. It was just a brief kiss/ make out, but I remember how new(ish) it all felt. I suppose I never expected a fantasy to become reality. Sadly it doesn\u2019t look like we will be able to do anything more risqu\u00e9 for a while with how life is going, but we are up to do things if we get the chance. With that said we are still exploring other relations as they occur, serious or not. I\u2019ve definitely left some things out but I just thought I\u2019d share an update of sorts on how things are going.\n\nTLDR: I sent my cousin a pic, we\u2019ve been going back and forth, next time we see each other and are available we are trying to do something",
