This fetish I am really into is more taboo than that. It has always been something that I wrote in both guilt and fear about many times in my personal private writings. Why it's caused me guilt is because I am very much into vore and have jerked off to videos of girls swallowing mice, goldfish and other creatures alive. I mean just how in the fuck does one explain to anyone getting off on watching creatures get swallowed alive. \n\nDon't even know why I have this fetish and honestly it's just always been there. Just trying to explain it all in depth would be a story of it's own that would detract from what my sister has been doing around me this past week. \n\nIt all started last Monday night when watching Netflix together on the sofa. My sister went to grab herself a snack and came back with gummy bears that I frankly had not seen before as I don't eat those. Figured at first she merely acquired a new craving in her choice of snack foods.\n\nBut once my sister grabbed the first red candy out between her fingers she said, \"Hey lets pretend this is our bitch aunt Jane.\"\n\nSeeing her tongue run across her lips I watched quietly as she dropped the squishy little candy into her small mouth. My sister sucked on it between her lips and then quickly swallowed it down. She then giggled before telling me that our aunt would be tickling her from the inside if that really was her. \n\nGrowing embarrassed from the fact this was enough to actually turn me on I told her it was kind of messed up to pretend that it was family even if our aunt is a rich prude that doesn't mind rubbing in how poor our mom/us are compared to her. \n\nAfter that my sister kept eating the candy at a normal rate and acted like she just causally bought up that whole thing. God damn it though I couldn't stop thinking about how she played with that little gummy and swallowed it whole.\n\nThe next day at dinner time my sister told me she was starving and told me she wanted to go out somewhere really nice. This caught me by total surprise as she normally hates going out to eat and always said our parents were blowing too much on meals out. \n\nOn the drive over her stomach growled a few times and while normally I wouldn't even think about it. Having just seen what she did with the candy the night before my mind kept thinking of her as a sexy predator. Upon entering the restaurant the host asked where me and my girlfriend would like to sit.\n\nThat's when my sister calmly said a booth and I couldn't believe she didn't refute or deny that at all. Once seated I asked why let them think we are dating. My sister told me it didn't matter and I worry too much about what other people think. Nothing else really happened that night and thought maybe I was worrying too much to the point I was overthinking this whole situation. \n\nHowever 2 night's ago we started talking about the X file's and she brought up the episode about the sons that have sex with their mother that had no arms or legs. She asked what I thought of it and not really knowing how to react I said that sounded messed up.\n\nSomehow we talked just about every type of incest in great detail, but avoided brother/sister incest all together. Instead once that conversation ended my sister demanded I allow her to sleep in my room again. With reluctance I agreed as the overall atmosphere felt tense between us and told her keep on her side of the bed.\n\nOf course all rules are written to be broken and my sister in the middle of the night kissed my neck before hogging the covers while snuggling next to me. It honestly took a while before I fell asleep as at this point confusion ruled my mind.\n\nThe next morning she slept in and I had to gently push her off in order to go into the restroom. Later on that day she wearing nothing but her underwear pulled out some ice cream and savored it in such a dragged out way that she had to be teasing me intentionally.  \n\nDon't really know what to think at this point about the situation and while I know my fetish is odd it's not going away. So any insight or advice on this would be helpful as I don't know what to think of what has happened.  \n\nAlso as a side note I still have erectile dysfunction that has gotten only slightly better and plan on seeing a doctor about it despite the cost. Because after thinking it over it could be a health issue and well now I might need my dick to work right after all. ",

She is trying to show you, that she is Ok with your fetish. She is trying to show you that she is willing to pander to your fetish, if it pleasures you. She is trying to be into the same things you are into, in hopes that you like her. \n\nThat plus the insistence that you sleep in the same bed as her, the cuddling, the neck kisses. Everything you've said in your 2 posts, indicates strongly she is attracted to you. Possibly In love with you.\n\nBasically she is trying desperately to get your attention. That much is clear. It's your decision if you want to reciprocate. I suggest you do. She sounds like a sweet girl, who only wants to please you. I'm sure you'll be happy with her as a GF. But it's up to you. Choose carefully.\n\nAt the very least. You should tell her about your ED. That will explain why you don't have a girlfriend. She will stop wondering if you are gay. It might make her less interested. But you have to be honest. \n\nGood luck, keep us updated!",

Actually most of the time for the past 9 months even if I do orgasm my mind doesn't even blank out in the slightest and it feels like the effort wasn't even worth it. As for suggesting I masturbate while taking a warm shower. I actually used to jerk off standing while taking a shower, but now it's impossible for me to orgasm in less than 20 mins so I haven't done that in nearly 9 month's now.\n\nLast year I could orgasm 2-3 times in a night before going to sleep when masturbating. Sometimes I jerked off 4 times in a day but that left me with a sore dick. Now however it often hurts during and after the first orgasm. If I try for a 2nd my balls and tip hurt a lot for days.\n\nMainly though I worry about only being able to go one round if at all than about the fact my dick is only a tad over 6 inches long when hard. Anyways I will admit going for runs sounds like a good idea as I really don't have good endurance. And this year I have cut back a lot on the porn streaming in part because overall I have been much less horny day to day than I used to be. \n\nOn the other hand I've gotten so used to watching porn that until recently I kind of figured I was never going to lose my virginity as I don't really think I am the type of guy girls tend to be into. Was kind of depressed about it after getting out of high school, but got over it and ended up often getting more turned on by my odd fetish than the idea of having normal sex. So that's mostly why I haven't really tried to get a girlfriend before. ",

It took me a while to read it all and think about. However I don't see how my eating habit's are the cause of my ED because they have mostly been the same for last 3 years or so. Mostly tend to eat chocolate to wake up before eating baked chicken, sandwiches or pizza as one of my two meals per day. And I mostly stick to drinking water to save on cost. \n\nThe functional problem's I have are being unable to get hard at all 1/4th of the time I am horny and losing hardness in the middle of masturbation nearly every other time. It was really bad about a week ago where my mind was burning up with intense horny thoughts, but I couldn't rub one out and stayed up for 3 hours because of it. Normally I am lucky if I actually finish myself off in masturbation after working on it for half an hour or more often trying to guess if online porn, images or simply my own mind is what will actually work.\n\nAnd as for knowing if she ever went out with anyone I have asked but she won't tell me about her love life despite all the questions she asked about mine. The only thing she will say on the topic of ever dating or the like is that she isn't gay. When going out she dresses nicer for her friends, but complains about it a lot when she does saying girls are so judgmental on clothing choices. \n\nThat reminds me, she isn't the touchy feely type at all normally. Her friends don't hug her nor does anyone in my family as she doesn't like it most of the time. On the other hand even before moving in she did spend the night a few times at my place as the relationship between my mother and her is strained. The reason I moved out 3 years ago is because my grandparents died and left my mother a old house that she wanted to live in. At first due to short notice of my mothers choice I stayed with my bio dad whom I get along with until figuring out where I was going to live while going to college. \n\nGetting back to what's been happening lately we do spend quite a bit of time together. We can talk openly about a number of things, but honestly I really do feel self judgmental about my fetish and it's been hard to deal with even though I would never want anything harmful to happen in real life. It's also kind of embarrassing and so I have not yet brought the subject up despite her still eating some things in ways related to my fetish. \n\nThanks again for the thoughtful advice and hopefully I can work things out with her. It's just kind of nerve racking and I worry not only about misreading this all, but also what happens if things didn't work out. ",

Lemon and watermelon are the highest of alkaline foods you can have. \n\nRemoving soft drinks or any of those fake energy sport drinks like Gatorade, will help keep your blood, skin and mind healthy. Eating fish with small spinach leaves cherry tomatoes, cucumbers. Oatmeal or porridge with honey is also great. But using Soy Milk. Learning dishes with Tofu, Japanese style is delicious Chinese style tofu is hard and gross. But learning how to make soups with celery, carrots and zucchini and chicken with stock and soup mix, basically just lentils really lol. \n\nBut doing this doesn't mean you have to completely deny yourself things you enjoy.  But waiting awhile for the body to adjust. SUGAR IS MORE ADDICTIVE THAN SMOKING. America uses Corn Syrup and that causes your body a massive blood rush. It's in soft drinks Australia and others use Cain Syrup. But resist them, also Cow milk causes a sludge build up in your intestine causing your body a hard time to absorb the nutrients into your system along with sugar causes over eating. \n\nChicken, Turkey, lamb. They aren't to bad and beat pork and beef. Salad dressing bought normally has sugar. Yogurt is good cultured milk products are not as bad, but you want yogurt Greek with fruit mix, normally less sugar by far. It's not calories but what is in it as nearly every single thing I mentioned will taste so bad if your body is extremely high in its Acidity levels, causing liver kidney heart disease and diabetes, even clots as hydration is important as if you are high is acidic levels your red blood cells clump together. Taking magnesium supplements and even zinc. Not mixed tablets as they normally dont break down and you even shit them out the same as they went in. \n\nEating food slowly. But you want to focus on water quality a lot of bottled water uses a crap method. Remember what water becomes when oxygen is removed. Filtered water from your tap but i put it in a bottle and shake it like it does in nature bashing rocks filtering itself and keeping hydration quality up. But if you shake your water a bit it does go down smoother, also drinking room temperature is best as it doesn't need to cool before the body absorbs it. \n\nYou should change your diet before a doctor it may help. But fruit juice most of it is cordial or is rehydrated crap. Most the time finding decent orange juice that is close to as squeezing yourself is hard. But best ones won't say sugar and reconstitute on the back label. Now US has heaps of bad sugar corn Syrup cereals. You should ignore them. Also Coconut sugar is great substitute for white raw or what ever sugar. \n\nThe idea of if you cant make something your eating from scratch without a lab to synthesize you products. Dont have it. But it's hard to think your not allow as you will break faster say goals like one month of this and I can have some Hurshy chocolate. Yogurt ice cream is a great substitute to ice cream. \n\nYour sister does sound like she is interested, has she had boyfriends or sex to your knowledge. A great thing to do is ask what you mean to her like what does she think of you. Also ask her if she is happy living with you and is willing to stay and her ideas for her future. Tell her were ever you are will be home for her and she can feel safe and happy talking to you about what ever she wants. Try letting her know you think of her as a woman not just a sister. You need to try hard, seems you are clinging on to something invisible, if you are worried about your problem and it is stopping you from moving forward and worried it may turn her away I can assure you she will be more interested in helping and there is nothing wrong with pleasing your partner mentally and just with your mouth and hands. \n\nBut if you are to scared to say anything. Maybe start giving her a hug and kiss on the cheek before you leave for work or wake up before you have breakfast, see and witness her mood changes or reaction. She may see it as a shy sign of you wanting too be closer. She may turn her head quickly causing a quick kiss on the lips. She may leave it at that causing you to ask why and she might act all cheeky and gidish. But a person that sits and waits for the world to come to them end up with nothing, even if you just give her a hug every morning or night, I assure the kiss on cheek test but a hug and just saying it's great having you around and that you appreciate her. She might ask what's wrong but just smile and say nothing get her wondering.",
