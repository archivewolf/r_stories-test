                        "selftext": "Hey everyone, just an update as to what\u2019s been going on.  The beginning of this story can be found here:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/incest/comments/9mj74t/ms_not_your_average_vacation/\n\nI slept strangely well last night given how much was on my mind.  I got up around 8:00AM and poked around the internet like I usually do in the morning.  The first thing I do after that on most vacation/summer mornings is a light jog followed by some weights and then a bit of stretching.  I usually do this alone, but on occasion my Mom or my brother would tag along.  I really hoped my Mom was coming today because all she wears is a sports bra and this sexy yoga pants.  Combine that outfit with memories of last night and I\u2019m going just a little crazy.\n\n\nTo my disappointment, I did most of my work out alone.  I was just finishing off my workout with some stretches and I saw my Mom stroll into the gym.  It was her usual outfit, except she had a dri fit shirt over the sports bra.  She walked over to me and asked me if I wanted to join her for a Yoga Stretch that the ship was hosting.  I calmly accepted, my mind racing with images of positions and things that we would do.\n\n\nNow I\u2019m going to be straight, Yoga isn\u2019t that easy, so kudos to those who actually do it on a regular basis and no, it\u2019s really not as sexy or hot as you think it is.  But that doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t sexy at all.  At some point during the stretches, she must have gotten really hot, so she took off the shirt she was wearing and just had the sports bra on.  As if that wasn\u2019t enough to give me a raging boner, we also were in a position where her boobs were pressed flat against my back, which for whatever reason turned me on an insane amount.\n\n\nAfter the class and we got ready to go back to our rooms to get ready for brunch, my Mom asked my to hold her phone while she went to the washroom since she had no pockets.  I just stood against the wall, trying to flush images out of my head because hiding a boner in my work out shorts was difficult.  I ended up just pushing my penis to one side of my shorts and casually tap my legs as I waited.  As my Mom left the washroom, she casually put her hands in my pocket and just grabbed.  I imagine she thought she was getting her phone, but no, it was my super erect penis.   I\u2019m pretty sure we both turned red beyond belief and just averted eye contact.  That felt so damn good.\n\n\nWe didn\u2019t talk about the previous night after that because when I returned to my room, my siblings were up and everyone was getting ready for brunch.  I figured I\u2019d just talk to her about it later that night.\n\n\nMost of the day was uneventful.  We had a meal like a normal family and then got ready to board the island.  It was one of those smaller islands, so we had to be \u201ctendered\u201d onto it.  It just means we had to take a smaller boat to reach the pier of the island.  Maybe it was wishful thinking of me or maybe it\u2019s just my mindset, but something happened during the tender that made me wonder.  The sea was a little rough and my Mom was sitting across from me.  The boat hit a big wave and caused it to shake and rock quite a bit.  Most people just shook around in their seats, but my mom flew off her seat and landed onto my lap.  Her boobs were pressed against my chest and her whole lower body was pressed against mine.  I almost instantly got a boner and tried my absolute best to make her feel it.  She brushed it off with a \u201cSorry honey\u201d, her gaze averted.\n\n\nThe rest of the afternoon was pretty standard.  We hit the beach, looked at gift shops, the usual loungey vacation thing to do.  I remembered some of the comments here so I tried to bring them up.  I asked her about Sam and how her night with him went.  She said it was good and that she wasn\u2019t sure if she was going to see him again.  I tried my best to hide my excitement when I asked why and all she really said was; \u201cHe\u2019s not what I\u2019m looking for\u201d.\n\nAnyway, after a long day in the sun, we were all exhausted.  We just had a quick dinner and began to do our own things.  Before I ran off to grab some sweets and a drink, my Mom called me over and asked me;\n\n\u201cHoney can you come to my room?  I got burned on the beach and could use some lotion on my back.\u201d\n\nJeeeeez.  I know this could mean literally nothing but hell, thoughts raced through my mind.\n\n\nObviously I agreed and we went back to her room.  She immediately began to undress, at which point I politely turned around.  She said;\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be silly, you\u2019re going to have to see this to put the lotion on anyway.\u201d\n\nSo I turn back around and see a black bra and lacy black underwear.  That\u2019s literally my favourite bra/underwear combo.  Not that she could possibly know that. I think.  Anyway, with a raging boner and her laying on her belly, I started to apply the lotion on her back while kneeling on the ground.  As my wet, lotioned hands touch her skin, even more ideas begin to flow through my mind.  I wanted to give it to her.  So. Damn. Bad.  \n\n\nAnyway, after applying the sunburn lotion she asks for a short massage before I leave (it\u2019s something I usually do for her after she finishes work).  Of course I agree and to prevent her from feeling my boner, I continue to do it in my kneeling position.  After only a moment of doing that, she says;\n\n\u201cJust come on the bed and sit on my butt or legs or something, it can\u2019t be comfortable there.\u201d\n\n\nI felt like time froze here.  I could casually sit on the bed and pretend nothing is going on or I could basically show her my boner.  I had an escape plan, so I thought I\u2019d go for it.  So I sit on her butt with my raging boner and I make damn sure she can feel it.  I feel her jump a little and say \u201cOh!\u201d.  I asked her if everything was ok and she replied that it was.\n\n\nI decided it was enough evidence and took a leap.  I asked her about her night with Sam, admitted that I heard her say my name during sex with him and what it meant.  The room was quiet for what felt like hours until she finally squeaked;\n\n\u201cExactly what it sounded like\u201d\n\nI asked her about the comment she made when she caught me masturbating and she again squeaked;\n\n\u201cExactly what it sounded like\u201d\n\nI was silent for what I hope was only a second and boldly replied:\n\n\u201cAre you lucky?\u201d \n\nI felt like I was in a lame porno or B movie that plays on Saturday.  Her eyes widened and she slowly backed away from me.  I thought;\n\n\u201cDammit, you idiot, moving to damn fast, of course this is going to happen, she\u2019s your mother and was just making comments because the situation was awkward as is.\u201d\n\nAs she backed away from me on the bed, she jumped off of it and tiptoed over to the door and slowly locked all of the locks on the door.  She slowly walked back to me and asks...\n\n\u201c...do...you want me to?\u201d\n\nI replied with,\n\n\u201c...only if you\u2019re comfortable doing so.\u201d\n\nHoly. Shit. There\u2019s no way this is actually happening to me.  She began to play with my penis through my pants and I just sat there, pulled my hair back and began to breath heavily.  After the hand over the pants, she began to undo my belt slowly before pulling off my pants and my boxers.  She just stared at my erect penis and said\n\n\u201cMmmmm\u201d\n\nBefore I knew it my whole penis was in her mouth.  I felt her tongue move all around it and her lips just felt so damn good around it.  My Mom was sucking my dick. Holy shit and she was good at it.  Now I\u2019m not going to be one of those cool guys and say this lasted a long time.  I have to think of mundane things to keep myself from jizzing, but I really couldn\u2019t in this situation.  It was too hot.  When I had to finish,  I grabbed a cup that was on the bedside table and pulled it to my Mom\u2019s head and tried to signal I had to orgasm.  She just said;\n\n\u201cmmm mmmm\u201d\n\nAll while knocking the cup out of my hand, sucking harder and faster.  As a result I pushed her head down on my penis and jizzed a huge load into her mouth.  She swallowed it all. I had just orgasmed, but somehow still insanely aroused.\n\n\nAfter that insane blow job, we talked a little and lay in bed watching a movie, clothed like mother and son would be.  Since she had just swallowed a load of mine, I asked her if I\u2019d ever get to put my penis in her and she just winked.  She told me to wait for a day at sea.\n\nTomorrow we\u2019re at another island, then the day after is a day at sea.  I\u2019ll keep everyone posted.\n\nPS: My Mom is 54 and I\u2019m 25.  Trust me, she doesn\u2019t look 54 at all.",
