Just never really got along or went out of our way to talk to each other.\n\nRoughly 6 months ago i was hanging with a guy named derek\n\nDerek dated my younger sister for a year, dumped her for a mulitiude reasons that i wont go into( but I can see why he did honestly), and is my younger brothers best freind. He is also cousin of my older sisters fiance, so even tho him and my sister split hes family and is always around. So much so that even tho they broke up there basically always around each other 24/7 because the fiance took derek in as a surgate son kind of thing(derek lives at my older sisters house 90% of the time basicully).\n\nRegardless i like Derek, hes a good man. Just never really worked out for him and my sister\n\nWho cares there grown up or so i thought\n\nNow at this point i believe my sister is a goody little tushu, she never did any drugs. Never went to a party, when her and derek were dating she would hide in the house when he was over because she was so nervous and just watched him play basketball with my brother out her window.\n\nThat kind of innocent\n\nSo realize my surprise when im hanging with derek one day and he stops me to tell me that my younger sister is essentally a big thot that begs him to stay at my older sisters house for the night to fuck her when she comes over later on a weekly basis.\n\nAnd thats why he stays at my older sisters house and not go home to his real parents house\n\nSee Derek knows i wont get angry if he tells me this because he knows i never really gave a shit before about her since our relationship was so strained( im p sure me and her spoke mabye a thosand words max to each other in the 20 yrs of living together)\n\nHe was right i wasnt angry, i was jealous\n\nI think something broke in her head when it comes to Derek. Like she had these massive plans with him, he never knew about. So now shes using her pussy to try and convince him 2 come back expect he doesnt care cause hes fucking some other girl while hes at it. Worse part is she knows hes fucking another girl, and still conviced herself that he will come back to her if she keeps fucking him.\n\nHe starts showing me all these texts of her begging for it, sending nudes, he even showed me a 2 sec video of her getting it behind on my fucking older sister couch that i just slept on like a month ago.\n\nMeanwhile im telling him shit like, \"yeh watever\" on the surface. Just talking like its any other girl without seeming too intrested cause to him its just my annoying sister i don't give a shit about, while my pants get tighter and tighter.\n\nFor like the last 6 months ive been doing nothing but fantasizing about her. I always had a bit of a thing for her for years, but now i cant stop thinkin about her sending those texts, and begging me.\n\nI think it makes it hotter for me is  I do honestly believe i have a shot if i played my cards just right. I do believe there is a universe where my little sister is begging me for my dick. I heard her comment that im cute a few times 2 a few people when she thinks im not actully lisisting into her convo(example her freinds), and i also swear when its just us two in a room the tension gets way thicker. \n\n\nFellas I need advice. I feel like the best tatic would be to silenty put myself back in her life with texting (never text her once, have her number for family reasons) what do you all think?",
