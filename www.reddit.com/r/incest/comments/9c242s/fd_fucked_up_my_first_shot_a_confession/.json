He\u2019s really never been particularly parental. My family is very religious, but my father doesn\u2019t really seem to want to continue with that life. Whenever my mother goes out of town, he practically begs me and my friends to go drinking with him.\nSeven months ago, we all got super drunk and ended up crashing at his place. When I went into his bedroom to say goodnight, I was wearing just one of his tee shirts and some panties, and he was only in his boxers. We hugged, and then we started to rub our bodies up against each other\u2019s.\nBefore I really even registered what was happening, he had lifted up my shirt and was sucking on my tit while rubbing my clit. I started rubbing his cock through his boxers. And then I lost control.\nI needed his cock in my mouth, so I got on my knees and started bobbing. After a few minutes, he pulled me up and bent me over on the bed. He put a tiny drop of lube on his dick and slipped inside of me. It was the most incredible feeling of my life.\nBut after only two or three pumps, he remembered we weren\u2019t alone in the house and panicked. He rushed me out of his room, shut the door, and I heard the distinct sound of the door locking.\nI waited a few hours before I snuck back out of my room, and I noticed his door was cracked open. I snuck in, still wearing only his tee shirt. He was laying stark naked with the sheets wrapped in a way to make sure everything was showing. I couldn\u2019t resist.\nI slipped into his bed and started giving him a hand job. After about five minutes, instead of reciprocating, he told me I had to go.\nThe next morning, he came into my room and told me \u2018Last night never happened.\u2019\nI realize now I should have sucked him off instead, and then just hopped on his dick, but I wanted to make sure it was what he wanted.\nWhen he texted me a few days later to see if we were okay, I said I just wanted to pretend like it hadn\u2019t happened. I was so embarrassed by his rejection that I couldn\u2019t admit I wanted it to happen again.\nShould I admit to him that I don\u2019t think it was a mistake?
