At some point we started washing each other's backs.   \n\n\nWe kept on doing that until like two weeks ago in the shower I was washing her back again and at some point I decided I'm gonna wash the rest of her body. I washed her arms and her shoulders and then I turned her around gently, kissed her, and started playing with her breasts. She seemed to go along with it so I started going with one of my hands toward her pussy but she stopped it, holding my wrist. I asked her what's wrong and she said that she's confused and that she doesn't know if this is right and all of that... So I kissed her again and after a while I stopped and told her that it's ok and we can talk about it later.  \n\n\n I got out of the shower to give her some space, dried up and got out of the bathroom. Later that night she called me to her room to talk and I told her that I love her but that I also feel attracted to her and I think she is too. She said she doesn't know what she feels but she's been very lonely for a long time and that she's somehow \"crazy\" and \"terrible\" for letting me get intimate with her (showering, sleeping in the same bed etc). It was a little longer than that but I don't remember all the details. Anyway, I ended up kissing her on the lips gradually getting my hand on her (shirt covered) breast and also taking her hand and putting it on my (boxers covered) dick. She left her hand there on her own and I literally said \"I really need to cum\" to which she replied that she can't, at this point leaving her grip on my bulge and standing up... I stood up too and went to my room, jacked off, went to sleep.  \n\n\nSince then I have also started caressing her legs which leads to me massaging her body but I don't really touch her sexually when we do that. Also started doing little things like putting my arm around her and my thumb under the waistband of her panties when we watch tv. We still shower together and sometimes we end up kissing but she just won't let me take it further. I'd be happy to get some advice.",
