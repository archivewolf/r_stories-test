You can read more below, but needless to say you were right and me and Ashley faced this head on. Thanks for your thoughts and comments!\n\n/u/thefrigginforest ([Comment](https://old.reddit.com/r/incest/comments/9ivugc/bs_my_sister_visited_me_in_the_shower_and_now_i/e6mxu7v/)): You hit the nail on the head with this one. Read more below in my update but you may have a hidden ability to see the future. You should probably look into developing that skill more ;) Thanks so much for your thoughts, comments like yours are why I post here for advice!\n\n/u/Ravengrey67 ([Comment](https://old.reddit.com/r/incest/comments/9ivugc/bs_my_sister_visited_me_in_the_shower_and_now_i/e6np87l/)): Yeah both me and Ashley missed #4 in the moment. I am sure that contributed to Sarah's suspicions. Several articles of clothes were still in Ashley's room. More on that below. Thanks for your comments, appreciate you taking the time!\n\n/u/PM_ME_YO_ASSHOLE ([Comment](https://old.reddit.com/r/incest/comments/9ivugc/bs_my_sister_visited_me_in_the_shower_and_now_i/e6nklia/)): First of all, your username is the stuff of legends. Legit laughed out loud. Second, I agree wholeheartedly with your statement about not using Sarah's sexuality. While I agree with most comments that say her sexuality and experiences will possibly make it easier for her to accept me and Ashley, I would never actively bring that up and use that against her/try to use that to temper her response. That will all be on her. Thanks for reinforcing what I already thought! Appreciate your time!\n\n/u/Revo63 ([Comment](https://old.reddit.com/r/incest/comments/9ivugc/bs_my_sister_visited_me_in_the_shower_and_now_i/e6npjsx/)): \"The downfall of clever people is that they forget that there are a whole lot of other smart people out there as well.\" Truer words have never been spoken. Me and Ash were feeling kinda invincible after setting up our move and telling our Mom about our plans to move in together without any suspicion. Definitely not the smartest either of us have felt having such a 180 on our moods happened so shortly afterwards. I definitely trust Sarah, but this is a big secret to keep if you're not ok with it. We shall see... regardless, thank you for your comment!\n\n/u/Delly_Smarts ([Comment](https://old.reddit.com/r/incest/comments/9ivugc/bs_my_sister_visited_me_in_the_shower_and_now_i/e6nipy3/)): You know it's funny, the thought crossed my mind of using the porn thing, but A) I've never been one to watch porn loudly and B) It just seemed too ridiculous. Plus Ashley coming out half-naked and a few other factors would have almost immediately removed any doubt that it wasn't porn! Good thought though! Thanks for your comment!\n\n/u/DikBinninya1234 ([Comment](https://old.reddit.com/r/incest/comments/9ivugc/bs_my_sister_visited_me_in_the_shower_and_now_i/e6nl948/)): This actually came up at dinner this past Saturday night. I just left it out of my post. Sarah had actually driven down the night before after talking with our Mom so that she would have some time to hang out with us during the day before heading back after dinner. So she arrived the night before, after me and Ash had already passed out, and just made her way to the guest room and fell asleep. We all still have keys to my Mom's house, including Sarah. That is how she was there so early, and why she put on a pot of coffee (she had woken up not too long before we had, unfortunately she woke up early enough to hear me and Ash). Sorry for leaving that detail out!\n\n/u/saltyhnter ([Comment](https://old.reddit.com/r/incest/comments/9ivugc/bs_my_sister_visited_me_in_the_shower_and_now_i/e6o91lp/)): I'll go into more detail below, but I planned to let Sarah kind of just go off on us and expand on what she thinks she knows and then go from there. I didn't want to divulge anything that wasn't necessary. If she is accepting of everything I will have no issue coming clean with her completely. It all depends on her. Thanks for your thoughts and comments!\n\n/u/dayamthisshitgood ([Comments](https://old.reddit.com/r/incest/comments/9ivugc/bs_my_sister_visited_me_in_the_shower_and_now_i/e6nbd2o/)): It sucks, not gonna lie. But I am hoping that it gets easier with time! Thanks for commenting!\n\n/u/AAnderson35 ([Comment](https://old.reddit.com/r/incest/comments/9ivugc/bs_my_sister_visited_me_in_the_shower_and_now_i/e6nm831/)): Thank you for your thoughts and prayers! As someone who is agnostic I am not sure how far those prayers will go on me, but it's the thought that counts, right? I definitely plan on doing everything with Ashley. Thanks for commenting, I appreciate your thoughts!\n\n/u/JennyTheFluffyBunny ([Comment](https://old.reddit.com/r/incest/comments/9ivugc/bs_my_sister_visited_me_in_the_shower_and_now_i/e6rj7qn/)): Yeah, Sarah had it pretty rough growing up. She made some... interesting choices. Getting knocked up and having a kid at a young age kinda made her have to mature way sooner than she should have. And then going through the process of figuring out she was gay was a whole other ordeal, ending with the father of her daughter cutting all ties. I was a little too young to be of any use to her other than a few shoulders to cry on (not really understanding what she was going through at the time). Not really even in the same category as me and Ash, but I think she at least can understand how it is to be/feel a little taboo/uncommon. The hair dying idea is not something I considered at all. Me and Ashley don't have similar hair (she has my Mom's almost black hair, and mine is much lighter) but it would at the very least make us a little less recognizable. I've never thought about dying my hair, not sure about Ashley. But definitely something we'll consider! Thanks for your thoughts, comments, and suggestion! Much appreciated! :)\n\n*If I didn't respond to your comment specifically, know that I read everyone's comments and I really appreciate everyone taking time to reply. There was a lot of duplicate advice so I responded the ones with the most info or upvotes, or ones with unique stuff in them!*\n\n---\n\nSo, moving on, this will probably be my shortest update. I just wanted to give an update since there was some stuff left hanging at the end of my last post. Please forgive any spelling or other errors as well. I'm writing this quickly before bed, I have a long weekend coming up.\n\nI spoke with Sarah for a while tonight. I decided to call her just because I didn't think text would cut it. Many people said in comments that I needed to do this in person, and if not in person over the phone, and I agreed. The conversation wasn't that long, and Ashley was with me for it listening in.\n\nI talked with Ashley before calling Sarah. I asked her if she had any reason to believe that she may have told Sarah about her feelings towards me at any point when she was younger and Sarah had been around more. She couldn't recall anything, but admitted it was entirely possible she had forgotten something from that long ago. I also told her that my shirt and a couple of other things were probably within view when Sarah was in her room, which she said she realized afterwards too but Sarah hadn't said anything when she was in there to her. The only thing Sarah mentioned was Ash's outfit, and that it was \"sexier than anything she owned\" and wondered if \"she had someone to be dressing that sexy for\". Ashley didn't read too much into it at the time, but now it was kinda obvious where she was going with that.\n\nI gave Sarah a call and she answered quickly. I could tell she was a little weird right from the start.\n\n**Sarah:** \"Hey\"\n\n**Me:** \"Hey... sorry I didn't text you back. I didn't see it for a while.\"\n\n**Sarah:** \"Oh I'm SURE that's why!\"\n\n**Me:** \"Ok well on that note, why don't you tell me what you're thinking and then we can just take it from there.\"\n\n**Sarah:** \"What I'm thinking? I'm thinking I kinda wish I hadn't come out there now.\"\n\n**Me:** \"Listen no offense, but if you don't think you need to actually say whatever is on your mind, I am perfectly happy to just end this conversation right now. You're the one accusing me of something.\"\n\n**Sarah:** \"...is Ashley with you?\"\n\nI looked at Ashley, who shook her head \"no\" violently.\n\n**Me:** \"No, she is not. But she knows you texted me and that I am calling you.\"\n\nI told her that knowing that there was no real reason for me to tell Ashley about the texts if she wasn't involved. The ball was firmly in Sarah's court.\n\n**Sarah:** \"Ok, well...\"\n\n*Silence for a good 15-20 seconds.* I heard her moving through her house and opening and closing a few doors, with the sound of a sliding glass door the last thing I heard. She had gone outside onto her deck, no doubt to get out of earshot of her girlfriend and kids.\n\n**Sarah:** *sigh* \"If I am way off base here I am sorry but... part of me thinks that you and Ashley...\"\n\nI looked at Ashley and she just mouthed \"Oh my god\" to me. I gave her some hand signals indicating that she should chill.\n\n**Me:** \"Wow, ok, me and Ashley what?\"\n\n**Sarah:** \"Look, I'm not an idiot. You don't have to tell me because I already know.\"\n\n**Me:** \"Already know WHAT Sarah? I would love to know exactly what you're accusing me of.\"\n\n**Sarah:** \"I'm not ONLY accusing YOU. You two are idiots and were WAY too obvious that morning for me to have not put this together.\"\n\n**Me:** \"Listen, whatever you think you know, I think we shou-\"\n\n**Sarah:** \"You guys are hooking up, right?\"\n\nI stayed silent while my brain attempted to slot words together into a coherent sentence.\n\n**Sarah:** \"I'll take your silence as a 'yes'. Putting aside how fucked up that is, that means she finally did something, right? I'm assuming this was more her doing than yours?\"\n\nI looked at Ashley again, she had her hands on either side of her head, elbows out to the side, like she was putting her head in a vise. I put my hands up in the air, giving her a \"Well now what?\" kinda look. I put my phone on mute for a second.\n\n**Me:** \"Are you still 'not here'? Am I answering her right now?\"\n\n**Ashley:** \"Fuck me, she already knows. What the hell?\"\n\nI pointed at the phone and raised my eyebrows.\n\n**Ashley:** \"... Yeah, I guess so. There is no reason to keep playing dumb.\"\n\nShe fell back down into her chair.\n\n**Ashley:** \"Why is she assuming this was all me?!\"\n\nI un-muted the phone.\n\n**Me:** \"... You're quite the detective. But why are you blaming Ashley?\"\n\n**Sarah:** \"Ugh... so I was right?\"\n\nYeah... she still wasn't 100% sure until I confirmed it to her.\n\n**Me:** \"I'm sorta in shock that you're not like... coming to kill me right now. Why are you not freaking out?\"\n\n**Sarah:** \"... I read her diary years ago.\"\n\n**Ashley:** \"OH COME ON!\"\n\n**Sarah:** \"There she is! You been there hiding the whole time? You're terrible at it. You've always been terrible at it.\"\n\n**Ashley:** \"Are you kidding me right now? Don't be a bitch! What do you know about me?\"\n\n**Sarah:** \"Bitch? Uhh, no. A bitch would have told Mom you were a little weirdo who was in love with our fucking brother her whole life years ago. You think you were sneaky? Your big sister knows everything. I figured you were going to grow out of it. But even after I moved out, I'd come home for Thanksgiving or whatever and there you were, still starring at him when you thought nobody was looking with those googly eyes..\"\n\nAshley started crying after the \"fucking weirdo\" line. After Sarah paused, Ashley grabbed my phone from me and started yelling and blubbering into it. Her reactions and emotions reminded me of how she got when we were still talking things out all those weeks ago.\n\n**Ashley:** \"Sarah... PLEASE don't do anything yet. DON'T tell Mom... Please don't ruin this! It was so hard, you don't know... I'm sorry I'm a weirdo... I'm sorry... but don't do anything stupid! The thought of you... doing that to-... I just can't...\"\n\nI had kept my mouth shut when they started talking to each other. I'd never really heard Sarah and Ashley go at it or talk like that to each other. There had always been a good sized age gap between them when we were all still living together and when Sarah was still coming home more often. It almost felt like this was the first time I had watched them truly interact as adults with each other.\n\nI couldn't stand watching Ashley upset like that. I got up and hugged her into me tightly as I lightly pulled the phone from her hands.\n\n**Sarah:** \"Whoa, easy there. I didn't say anything about doing anything...\"\n\n**Me:** \"She's not a weirdo, Sarah. She felt insanely conflicted over this.\"\n\n**Sarah:** \"I'm not sure what to think about YOU right now, either. How did she dupe you into this? Did she catch you drunk or something? Or are you a willing participant in this?\"\n\n**Ashley:** \"There is no DUPING going on here, Sarah! How can you say that?!\"\n\n**Sarah:** \"Because you two are smart! How can you think this is the right choice?! (My name), I always expected that you'd be the voice of REASON if she decided to actually do something! And Ashley, how could you drag him into this fantasy? How long has this been going on? Did you ask Mom about living with him before you did something?\"\n\nShe was starting to sound like she was lecturing her kids... except, you know, way different topic. Kind of annoying since she's not THAT much older than me. And she obviously was missing a lot of information and facts about what exactly was going on between me and Ash.\n\n**Me:** \"Sarah, if you're not planning on telling Mom, what are you planning to do? And before you answer, know that I am a 'willing participant' and would be fine with talking more about this with you.\"\n\nSarah was quiet for a while. Ashley stopped crying and was sitting on my lap as we both stared at the phone.\n\n**Me:** \"I think we should meet up. I am moving up to (new town) this weekend. I was going to go tomorrow to get a few things done up there, but I'd be willing to meet you halfway to your place, like in (town about midway between our Mom's and Sarah's), for lunch and to talk. Ashley could come too if she's free.\"\n\n**Sarah:** \"... I would be ok with that. But only if Ashley is there too. And I can't do this weekend. It would have to be next week sometime or next weekend.\"\n\nHer kids have some stuff to do this weekend that she can't get out of so we are going to meet up next Saturday for lunch about halfway to her place. I was planning on coming back to my Mom's to pick up the rest of my stuff that weekend anyway, so another 2 or so hours more driving to meet Sarah isn't a big deal. I should be able to pick up Ashley on my way through to meet up with Sarah.\n\nWe hung up shortly afterwards. Ashley is pretty freaked out. Her and Sarah have always had a kind of weird relationship because of their age gap, so she is worried to say the least. She is totally freaked out by the idea that Sarah has known about her feelings for me for so long as well. She is still pretty sure she never told her anything herself, so if it really was only the diary and observing her actions for years that is pretty crazy even to me. Ashley said that she never did anything really obvious, at least that is what she thought. I reminded her that she admitted to me that she used to sneak peaks of me in the bathroom and masturbate to thoughts of me, to which she replied, \"Yeah but she couldn't know what I was thinking... and I have no idea how she could have seen me sneak a peak those few times.\"\n\nSo that's where everything stands. Not much got resolved, other than we know Sarah knows and that she has apparently had suspicions for a very long time.\n\nI'm sure I'll be posting after we talk to Sarah. I'm hoping that things go well, but I guess as long as we come out of this with her agreeing not to tell anyone it will be a huge win. Any advice people have for a conversation like this would obviously be worth its weight in gold right about now for me, so lay it on me! Thanks everyone!",

While I agree with most comments that say her sexuality and experiences will possibly make it easier for her to accept me and Ashley, I would never actively bring that up and use that against her/try to use that to temper her response. That will all be on her. Thanks for reinforcing what I already thought! Appreciate your time!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"/u/Revo63\"&gt;/u/Revo63&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/incest/comments/9ivugc/bs_my_sister_visited_me_in_the_shower_and_now_i/e6npjsx/\"&gt;Comment&lt;/a&gt;): &amp;quot;The downfall of clever people is that they forget that there are a whole lot of other smart people out there as well.&amp;quot; Truer words have never been spoken. Me and Ash were feeling kinda invincible after setting up our move and telling our Mom about our plans to move in together without any suspicion. Definitely not the smartest either of us have felt having such a 180 on our moods happened so shortly afterwards. I definitely trust Sarah, but this is a big secret to keep if you&amp;#39;re not ok with it. We shall see... regardless, thank you for your comment!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"/u/Delly_Smarts\"&gt;/u/Delly_Smarts&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/incest/comments/9ivugc/bs_my_sister_visited_me_in_the_shower_and_now_i/e6nipy3/\"&gt;Comment&lt;/a&gt;): You know it&amp;#39;s funny, the thought crossed my mind of using the porn thing, but A) I&amp;#39;ve never been one to watch porn loudly and B) It just seemed too ridiculous. Plus Ashley coming out half-naked and a few other factors would have almost immediately removed any doubt that it wasn&amp;#39;t porn! Good thought though! Thanks for your comment!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"/u/DikBinninya1234\"&gt;/u/DikBinninya1234&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/incest/comments/9ivugc/bs_my_sister_visited_me_in_the_shower_and_now_i/e6nl948/\"&gt;Comment&lt;/a&gt;): This actually came up at dinner this past Saturday night. I just left it out of my post. Sarah had actually driven down the night before after talking with our Mom so that she would have some time to hang out with us during the day before heading back after dinner. So she arrived the night before, after me and Ash had already passed out, and just made her way to the guest room and fell asleep. We all still have keys to my Mom&amp;#39;s house, including Sarah. That is how she was there so early, and why she put on a pot of coffee (she had woken up not too long before we had, unfortunately she woke up early enough to hear me and Ash). Sorry for leaving that detail out!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"/u/saltyhnter\"&gt;/u/saltyhnter&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/incest/comments/9ivugc/bs_my_sister_visited_me_in_the_shower_and_now_i/e6o91lp/\"&gt;Comment&lt;/a&gt;): I&amp;#39;ll go into more detail below, but I planned to let Sarah kind of just go off on us and expand on what she thinks she knows and then go from there. I didn&amp;#39;t want to divulge anything that wasn&amp;#39;t necessary. If she is accepting of everything I will have no issue coming clean with her completely. It all depends on her. Thanks for your thoughts and comments!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"/u/dayamthisshitgood\"&gt;/u/dayamthisshitgood&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/incest/comments/9ivugc/bs_my_sister_visited_me_in_the_shower_and_now_i/e6nbd2o/\"&gt;Comments&lt;/a&gt;): It sucks, not gonna lie. But I am hoping that it gets easier with time! Thanks for commenting!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"/u/AAnderson35\"&gt;/u/AAnderson35&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/incest/comments/9ivugc/bs_my_sister_visited_me_in_the_shower_and_now_i/e6nm831/\"&gt;Comment&lt;/a&gt;): Thank you for your thoughts and prayers! As someone who is agnostic I am not sure how far those prayers will go on me, but it&amp;#39;s the thought that counts, right? I definitely plan on doing everything with Ashley. Thanks for commenting, I appreciate your thoughts!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"/u/JennyTheFluffyBunny\"&gt;/u/JennyTheFluffyBunny&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/incest/comments/9ivugc/bs_my_sister_visited_me_in_the_shower_and_now_i/e6rj7qn/\"&gt;Comment&lt;/a&gt;): Yeah, Sarah had it pretty rough growing up. She made some... interesting choices. Getting knocked up and having a kid at a young age kinda made her have to mature way sooner than she should have. And then going through the process of figuring out she was gay was a whole other ordeal, ending with the father of her daughter cutting all ties. I was a little too young to be of any use to her other than a few shoulders to cry on (not really understanding what she was going through at the time). Not really even in the same category as me and Ash, but I think she at least can understand how it is to be/feel a little taboo/uncommon. The hair dying idea is not something I considered at all. Me and Ashley don&amp;#39;t have similar hair (she has my Mom&amp;#39;s almost black hair, and mine is much lighter) but it would at the very least make us a little less recognizable. I&amp;#39;ve never thought about dying my hair, not sure about Ashley. But definitely something we&amp;#39;ll consider! Thanks for your thoughts, comments, and suggestion! Much appreciated! :)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If I didn&amp;#39;t respond to your comment specifically, know that I read everyone&amp;#39;s comments and I really appreciate everyone taking time to reply. There was a lot of duplicate advice so I responded the ones with the most info or upvotes, or ones with unique stuff in them!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, moving on, this will probably be my shortest update. I just wanted to give an update since there was some stuff left hanging at the end of my last post. Please forgive any spelling or other errors as well. I&amp;#39;m writing this quickly before bed, I have a long weekend coming up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I spoke with Sarah for a while tonight. I decided to call her just because I didn&amp;#39;t think text would cut it. Many people said in comments that I needed to do this in person, and if not in person over the phone, and I agreed. The conversation wasn&amp;#39;t that long, and Ashley was with me for it listening in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I talked with Ashley before calling Sarah. I asked her if she had any reason to believe that she may have told Sarah about her feelings towards me at any point when she was younger and Sarah had been around more. She couldn&amp;#39;t recall anything, but admitted it was entirely possible she had forgotten something from that long ago. I also told her that my shirt and a couple of other things were probably within view when Sarah was in her room, which she said she realized afterwards too but Sarah hadn&amp;#39;t said anything when she was in there to her. The only thing Sarah mentioned was Ash&amp;#39;s outfit, and that it was &amp;quot;sexier than anything she owned&amp;quot; and wondered if &amp;quot;she had someone to be dressing that sexy for&amp;quot;. Ashley didn&amp;#39;t read too much into it at the time, but now it was kinda obvious where she was going with that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I gave Sarah a call and she answered quickly. I could tell she was a little weird right from the start.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sarah:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;Hey&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;Hey... sorry I didn&amp;#39;t text you back. I didn&amp;#39;t see it for a while.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sarah:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;Oh I&amp;#39;m SURE that&amp;#39;s why!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;Ok well on that note, why don&amp;#39;t you tell me what you&amp;#39;re thinking and then we can just take it from there.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sarah:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;What I&amp;#39;m thinking? I&amp;#39;m thinking I kinda wish I hadn&amp;#39;t come out there now.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;Listen no offense, but if you don&amp;#39;t think you need to actually say whatever is on your mind, I am perfectly happy to just end this conversation right now. You&amp;#39;re the one accusing me of something.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sarah:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;...is Ashley with you?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I looked at Ashley, who shook her head &amp;quot;no&amp;quot; violently.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;No, she is not. But she knows you texted me and that I am calling you.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I told her that knowing that there was no real reason for me to tell Ashley about the texts if she wasn&amp;#39;t involved. The ball was firmly in Sarah&amp;#39;s court.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sarah:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;Ok, well...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Silence for a good 15-20 seconds.&lt;/em&gt; I heard her moving through her house and opening and closing a few doors, with the sound of a sliding glass door the last thing I heard. She had gone outside onto her deck, no doubt to get out of earshot of her girlfriend and kids.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sarah:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;sigh&lt;/em&gt; &amp;quot;If I am way off base here I am sorry but... part of me thinks that you and Ashley...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I looked at Ashley and she just mouthed &amp;quot;Oh my god&amp;quot; to me. I gave her some hand signals indicating that she should chill.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;Wow, ok, me and Ashley what?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sarah:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;Look, I&amp;#39;m not an idiot. You don&amp;#39;t have to tell me because I already know.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;Already know WHAT Sarah? I would love to know exactly what you&amp;#39;re accusing me of.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sarah:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m not ONLY accusing YOU. You two are idiots and were WAY too obvious that morning for me to have not put this together.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;Listen, whatever you think you know, I think we shou-&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sarah:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;You guys are hooking up, right?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I stayed silent while my brain attempted to slot words together into a coherent sentence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sarah:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ll take your silence as a &amp;#39;yes&amp;#39;. Putting aside how fucked up that is, that means she finally did something, right? I&amp;#39;m assuming this was more her doing than yours?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I looked at Ashley again, she had her hands on either side of her head, elbows out to the side, like she was putting her head in a vise. I put my hands up in the air, giving her a &amp;quot;Well now what?&amp;quot; kinda look. I put my phone on mute for a second.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;Are you still &amp;#39;not here&amp;#39;? Am I answering her right now?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ashley:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;Fuck me, she already knows. What the hell?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I pointed at the phone and raised my eyebrows.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ashley:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;... Yeah, I guess so. There is no reason to keep playing dumb.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She fell back down into her chair.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ashley:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;Why is she assuming this was all me?!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I un-muted the phone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;... You&amp;#39;re quite the detective. But why are you blaming Ashley?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sarah:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;Ugh... so I was right?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yeah... she still wasn&amp;#39;t 100% sure until I confirmed it to her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m sorta in shock that you&amp;#39;re not like... coming to kill me right now. Why are you not freaking out?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sarah:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;... I read her diary years ago.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ashley:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;OH COME ON!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sarah:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;There she is! You been there hiding the whole time? You&amp;#39;re terrible at it. You&amp;#39;ve always been terrible at it.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ashley:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;Are you kidding me right now? Don&amp;#39;t be a bitch! What do you know about me?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sarah:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;Bitch? Uhh, no. A bitch would have told Mom you were a little weirdo who was in love with our fucking brother her whole life years ago. You think you were sneaky? Your big sister knows everything. I figured you were going to grow out of it. But even after I moved out, I&amp;#39;d come home for Thanksgiving or whatever and there you were, still starring at him when you thought nobody was looking with those googly eyes..&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ashley started crying after the &amp;quot;fucking weirdo&amp;quot; line. After Sarah paused, Ashley grabbed my phone from me and started yelling and blubbering into it. Her reactions and emotions reminded me of how she got when we were still talking things out all those weeks ago.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ashley:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;Sarah... PLEASE don&amp;#39;t do anything yet. DON&amp;#39;T tell Mom... Please don&amp;#39;t ruin this! It was so hard, you don&amp;#39;t know... I&amp;#39;m sorry I&amp;#39;m a weirdo... I&amp;#39;m sorry... but don&amp;#39;t do anything stupid! The thought of you... doing that to-... I just can&amp;#39;t...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had kept my mouth shut when they started talking to each other. I&amp;#39;d never really heard Sarah and Ashley go at it or talk like that to each other. There had always been a good sized age gap between them when we were all still living together and when Sarah was still coming home more often. It almost felt like this was the first time I had watched them truly interact as adults with each other.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I couldn&amp;#39;t stand watching Ashley upset like that. I got up and hugged her into me tightly as I lightly pulled the phone from her hands.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sarah:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;Whoa, easy there. I didn&amp;#39;t say anything about doing anything...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;She&amp;#39;s not a weirdo, Sarah. She felt insanely conflicted over this.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sarah:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m not sure what to think about YOU right now, either. How did she dupe you into this? Did she catch you drunk or something? Or are you a willing participant in this?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ashley:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;There is no DUPING going on here, Sarah! How can you say that?!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sarah:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;Because you two are smart! How can you think this is the right choice?! (My name), I always expected that you&amp;#39;d be the voice of REASON if she decided to actually do something! And Ashley, how could you drag him into this fantasy? How long has this been going on? Did you ask Mom about living with him before you did something?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She was starting to sound like she was lecturing her kids... except, you know, way different topic. Kind of annoying since she&amp;#39;s not THAT much older than me. And she obviously was missing a lot of information and facts about what exactly was going on between me and Ash.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;Sarah, if you&amp;#39;re not planning on telling Mom, what are you planning to do? And before you answer, know that I am a &amp;#39;willing participant&amp;#39; and would be fine with talking more about this with you.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sarah was quiet for a while. Ashley stopped crying and was sitting on my lap as we both stared at the phone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;I think we should meet up. I am moving up to (new town) this weekend. I was going to go tomorrow to get a few things done up there, but I&amp;#39;d be willing to meet you halfway to your place, like in (town about midway between our Mom&amp;#39;s and Sarah&amp;#39;s), for lunch and to talk. Ashley could come too if she&amp;#39;s free.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sarah:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;... I would be ok with that. But only if Ashley is there too. And I can&amp;#39;t do this weekend. It would have to be next week sometime or next weekend.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Her kids have some stuff to do this weekend that she can&amp;#39;t get out of so we are going to meet up next Saturday for lunch about halfway to her place. I was planning on coming back to my Mom&amp;#39;s to pick up the rest of my stuff that weekend anyway, so another 2 or so hours more driving to meet Sarah isn&amp;#39;t a big deal. I should be able to pick up Ashley on my way through to meet up with Sarah.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We hung up shortly afterwards. Ashley is pretty freaked out. Her and Sarah have always had a kind of weird relationship because of their age gap, so she is worried to say the least. She is totally freaked out by the idea that Sarah has known about her feelings for me for so long as well. She is still pretty sure she never told her anything herself, so if it really was only the diary and observing her actions for years that is pretty crazy even to me. Ashley said that she never did anything really obvious, at least that is what she thought. I reminded her that she admitted to me that she used to sneak peaks of me in the bathroom and masturbate to thoughts of me, to which she replied, &amp;quot;Yeah but she couldn&amp;#39;t know what I was thinking... and I have no idea how she could have seen me sneak a peak those few times.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So that&amp;#39;s where everything stands. Not much got resolved, other than we know Sarah knows and that she has apparently had suspicions for a very long time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m sure I&amp;#39;ll be posting after we talk to Sarah. I&amp;#39;m hoping that things go well, but I guess as long as we come out of this with her agreeing not to tell anyone it will be a huge win. Any advice people have for a conversation like this would obviously be worth its weight in gold right about now for me, so lay it on me! Thanks everyone!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

She's actually quite mature in every other regard. She just had a lot of pent up emotion about everything still.

Sarah is not distracted/altered by the emotions and hormones you and Ash are going through, thus she takes a long-term view. Sarah doesn't see how this relationship could be 'successful', you'll have to find a way of explaining to her that it is/could be, and Not a time bomb out to destroy her family.

I know Ashley didn't \"trick me\" into anything, if anything I'm the one who put the brakes on and made sure everything was carefully thought through before each step forward, so I'll have no problem reiterating that process to Sarah.",

You must accept the emotions that she feels, and work on them, to show her that you are both acting as responsible adults in this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFortunately, you're not alone, (After all, it was US that put you in this place in some way or another), and I think it's a good idea to prepare against these questions if they come forward.\n\n(And what better place on the internet than this sub-reddit?)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFirst and foremost, I recommend that you read the article in this sub reddit to answer the most difficult questions faced by incestuous couples:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Why the hell did you decide that you had to choose (Family), as your partner? What are you sick?\" (You are NOT sick, and you didn\u00b4t choose, you only follow what fell right. And after concideration, you decide that it was worth to give it a try, at least for some time.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Do you know the risks to your child that his parents are siblings? Do you know the monsters that will be born if you conceive one day?\" (It\u00b4s very risky for the 2 of you to concive with out a specialist making all the apropiate analysis, but with treatment and care, you can. Also there is adoption).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"How are you going to have children? Even if they adopt a child, someone will one day find out everything, and you and your children will bear the stigma. They will be treated like the pariahs of the town.\" (This is the self-profecy falasey, and if that happens, (not that you are planning to convice in the near future), you will face it as adults and treat as necesary)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"How could you do this to your brother / sister? Do you know what you do to her/his soul?\" (Both of you are adults, at the end is your desicion how to live, she can only support or don\u00b4t).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd a looooong etc ...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know you will find that (as long as) the 2 are responsible adults and understand the risks, there is nothing that anyone else can say to make a judgment on the 2.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs for your little sister... you need to talk to her, make her see that she MUST control her emotions.\n\nShe has you two on the ropes. You two will lose everything if she decides to tell you.\n\nYou must accept the emotions that she feels, and work on them, to show her that you are both acting as responsible adults in this.\n\nThat even if she does not understand it, at least she can accept it in some way.\n\nFinally, I recommend that you show your older sister this reddit, (without directly mentioning your post in this place). So that she understands that it is not something as strange as society shows it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat there are many people in reality, who understand, live and accept that they love people who should not, but still live happily.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMaybe someone in this reddit (by PM), can tell you their experiences and stories of how they live happily despite their condition as an incestuous couple, and you can use that as a lever to better explain to your sister the reality of their relationship.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat's just my opinion, I hope it serves you something.\n\n(Excuse my English, it's not my native language. Good luck.)",

You must accept the emotions that she feels, and work on them, to show her that you are both acting as responsible adults in this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, you&amp;#39;re not alone, (After all, it was US that put you in this place in some way or another), and I think it&amp;#39;s a good idea to prepare against these questions if they come forward.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(And what better place on the internet than this sub-reddit?)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First and foremost, I recommend that you read the article in this sub reddit to answer the most difficult questions faced by incestuous couples:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Why the hell did you decide that you had to choose (Family), as your partner? What are you sick?&amp;quot; (You are NOT sick, and you didn\u00b4t choose, you only follow what fell right. And after concideration, you decide that it was worth to give it a try, at least for some time.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Do you know the risks to your child that his parents are siblings? Do you know the monsters that will be born if you conceive one day?&amp;quot; (It\u00b4s very risky for the 2 of you to concive with out a specialist making all the apropiate analysis, but with treatment and care, you can. Also there is adoption).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;How are you going to have children? Even if they adopt a child, someone will one day find out everything, and you and your children will bear the stigma. They will be treated like the pariahs of the town.&amp;quot; (This is the self-profecy falasey, and if that happens, (not that you are planning to convice in the near future), you will face it as adults and treat as necesary)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;How could you do this to your brother / sister? Do you know what you do to her/his soul?&amp;quot; (Both of you are adults, at the end is your desicion how to live, she can only support or don\u00b4t).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And a looooong etc ...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know you will find that (as long as) the 2 are responsible adults and understand the risks, there is nothing that anyone else can say to make a judgment on the 2.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As for your little sister... you need to talk to her, make her see that she MUST control her emotions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She has you two on the ropes. You two will lose everything if she decides to tell you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You must accept the emotions that she feels, and work on them, to show her that you are both acting as responsible adults in this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That even if she does not understand it, at least she can accept it in some way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finally, I recommend that you show your older sister this reddit, (without directly mentioning your post in this place). So that she understands that it is not something as strange as society shows it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That there are many people in reality, who understand, live and accept that they love people who should not, but still live happily.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe someone in this reddit (by PM), can tell you their experiences and stories of how they live happily despite their condition as an incestuous couple, and you can use that as a lever to better explain to your sister the reality of their relationship.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s just my opinion, I hope it serves you something.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(Excuse my English, it&amp;#39;s not my native language. Good luck.)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

She didn't want to block the driveway for when my Mom got home.

If just one thing hadn't happened (my mom going to a reunion, me moving out the following weekend, Sarah calling my mom that evening before) then that night would have gone completely differently, and most likely without incident.

I certainly didn't mean to come across as needlessly insulting - more just that I read all your posts in one sitting and felt overwhelmed by how many red flags I picked up on, and was frustrated that nobody else seemed to be reading between the lines at all (I'm sure we can soberly acknowledge there is an active bias on this sub). I suppose in my haste to articulate a lot of ideas and attempt to unravel the massive narrative that has taken dominance over the past few months, I forewent careful language. By the time I reached the end of this update, I was about to burst. For that I'll apologize. I'm not your parent, I'm not here to chastise you or insult you. I have, however, lived enough to be able to recognize the way you feel in feelings I've had before.\n\nI realize I said I wouldn't respond, but I didn't expect you to apologize or realize your error, so I will do the same since I'm sure my tone wasn't the best either. This whole thing has been an emotional rollercoaster, but when I commit to something I am always all in, no matter what it is in my life. Now that I'm committed, having someone question the validity of all the soul aearching and hard decisions this late in the game is not easy to swallow, so I apologize if I came off like a jerk. This added hurdle with Sarah has me anxious, since I'm only about 24 hours removed from meeting with her now, so I'm a little tight.\n\n&gt;I think your definition of love is exactly a young person's definition of love. I do not believe that lusting after someone in your school play, kissing them unprompted, and hoping they'll mount you then and there is \"love.\" I think it's what a high schooler thinks love is. Not that we don't need those experiences, because we do. And they are perfectly valid. But I wouldn't build a lifelong foundation with that definition as the framework.\n\nIf you had messaged me privately I might go into more detail, but since we are public I will just say that I've taken careful measures in my writing and details so as to not have much of any chance this could be linked back to me in real life. The words said and the important things match up, but most of that would only be able to be identified by Ashley, Sarah, and I, and perhaps to a certain degree our Mom. That being said, everyone's definition of love is different. As I mentioned in my posts, I'm a romantic at heart and believe that love can overcome, regardless, if you commit and are honest. Some say that is cheesy and unrealistic, including Sarah and my Mom, but I believe differently. I don't think that's a \"young persons\" definition, I think it's an optimists definition. I'm a \"glass is half full\" kind of guy. Like I said, millions of people build a family on top of relationships started in middle or high school, when they are even younger and much more \"immature\" than Ash and I. They can't all be wrong and living some kind of false definition of love their whole lives.\n\n&gt;As I said, I don't think you'll take my advice. I think it'd be hard for you to do so even if you agreed with me at this point. I'm not even sure what you would do to change course now. You're committed on so many levels. And that's a lot of what scares me about your situation. This is not a relationship you can bail from without lasting consequence, like you're used to. (It sounds like you're an attractive charismatic guy, based on what you've said about women approaching you/your last ex being ready for marriage/Ashley saying you treat women like princesses/etc. As such, it doesn't seem like it's been a terrible stretch for you to find new relationships or meet new women. You don't seem too tender out of your last longish term relationship, for instance.) This relationship will obviously impact the rest of your lives, no matter what. You know that already, so I won't recite the implications for you again, but I don't know if you've ever actually experienced that before. In a short while you'll be living together. Even in otherwise normal relationships, that's fast. And it's just more barriers to get past if your feelings about this change.\n\nIf you truly did read everything in its entirety, then you should know that Ashley and I spent many hours discussing exactly what you said above: What if we break up? What if things change between us? \"What ifs\" were a major topic of discussion. You seemed to think Ashley was immature and acting like a high schooler, but for times other than a few heated moments (which everyone is entitled to, especially in a situation like ours) she is VERY collected about all this. Believe me, if she was an immature little girl I wouldn't be into it at all. But she is the opposite of that. She's got a great head on her shoulders, she knows what she wants and why she wants it, and she isn't trying to trick herself into thinking this will be easy. She's been preparing for this, in a way, for longer than most anyone ever could.\n\nYou also need to remember that we grew up together in a house where we relied on ourselves and each other because our Mom wasn't around. And it wasn't like I was her \"father figure\" like so many think. We were equals, just trying to get through to the next day and help our Mom by not burdening her more than she already was with all her jobs, etc. We all had to grow up a little faster than we'd probably have liked to, but we came out stronger and more independent because of it. I know you think we would be co-dependant in a bad way as a couple, but really it's the opposite. I can already tell and we haven't even moved in together yet. We're stronger and more complete together. It may sound crazy after only ~3 months, but I truly believe we can work if nothing stupid gets in our way. That's the only reason I have committed so hard to this path we are heading down. Ashley has said the same thing to me since we started allowing ourselves the freedom to just naturally progress at the speed we feel comfortable with, and because it's all felt so easy between us the whole time so far, maybe we've moved faster than most people would normally be comfortable with. The way we look at it we've already been living together, mostly alone, for almost ten years already. I don't think much will change once we are living together. Removing the possibility of my mom or sister walking in on us, which will be the only REAL difference once we move in together, isn't going to be something bad, it's only going to allow us the freedom we truly desire to suss out our relationship even further.\n\n&gt;It's okay to take risks and try new things, but it sounds like you're already treating this like a sure thing. But feelings change and life happens, and when they do it's nice to be able to react and pull back if necessary, and I don't see where you've left yourself room to do that. I believe you guys should talk about slowing down and giving yourselves somewhere to progress to in your relationship, whatever that means for you. If this thing does work out, then you've got your whole lives to escalate and expand your relationship to fit what you can accommodate.\n\nI wouldn't say I'm treating it as a sure thing, because nothing in life is guaranteed. I know that from my childhood and parents. But as I mentioned I'm all in on something I commit to. I'm putting every ounce of my being into my relationship with Ashley, because I love her and I want it to work with all of my heart now. I'm sure once we are living together things will slow down a bit. We are moving fast now mostly because this opportunity presented itself and we couldn't pass it up. I was moving out anyway, and she needed to get into a 4 year school. When the planet's align and present you with something like this, you don't turn your nose up at it. I've learned at least that much in my time on this planet. Ashley confessing, me accepting my feelings for her, moving into a relationship and then having the perfect opportunity to give our relationship a real chance away from the prying eyes of family and friends is almost too good to be true, and certainly wouldn't happen again without a lot more work and effort on our part. And we've talked about all this and we both know that we are lucky things worked out the way they have (minus the Sarah thing). We know we have a long, most likely hard, road ahead. Ashley especially since she's been mulling over that for far longer than I have.\n\n&gt;Like I said, I'm sorry about my previous tone. I do hope this works out for you two, in the same way I hope all relationships work out. But also, I would venture to say you've painted a very different picture with your subtext than you probably have in your conscious mind. I mean, I read stories on this sub all the time, and this is the first one where I picked up on enough red flags that I wanted to comment. Take that for what you will.\n\n&gt;Best of luck, and please be careful.\n\nThank you for the apology, your well wishes, and your time commenting. As always, I appreciate all feedback and I only have good things to say about this sub, despite the \"bias\" you mentioned. I've never had a problem with that bias though because sex and intimacy are part of any relationship and are especially important in a long lasting one. So the inclusion of detailed sexual encounters, at least in the non-fiction posts, I find are helpful to a degree. If people enjoy it enough that they're able to rub one out before commenting, more power to them I say!",

The words said and the important things match up, but most of that would only be able to be identified by Ashley, Sarah, and I, and perhaps to a certain degree our Mom. That being said, everyone&amp;#39;s definition of love is different. As I mentioned in my posts, I&amp;#39;m a romantic at heart and believe that love can overcome, regardless, if you commit and are honest. Some say that is cheesy and unrealistic, including Sarah and my Mom, but I believe differently. I don&amp;#39;t think that&amp;#39;s a &amp;quot;young persons&amp;quot; definition, I think it&amp;#39;s an optimists definition. I&amp;#39;m a &amp;quot;glass is half full&amp;quot; kind of guy. Like I said, millions of people build a family on top of relationships started in middle or high school, when they are even younger and much more &amp;quot;immature&amp;quot; than Ash and I. They can&amp;#39;t all be wrong and living some kind of false definition of love their whole lives.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As I said, I don&amp;#39;t think you&amp;#39;ll take my advice. I think it&amp;#39;d be hard for you to do so even if you agreed with me at this point. I&amp;#39;m not even sure what you would do to change course now. You&amp;#39;re committed on so many levels. And that&amp;#39;s a lot of what scares me about your situation. This is not a relationship you can bail from without lasting consequence, like you&amp;#39;re used to. (It sounds like you&amp;#39;re an attractive charismatic guy, based on what you&amp;#39;ve said about women approaching you/your last ex being ready for marriage/Ashley saying you treat women like princesses/etc. As such, it doesn&amp;#39;t seem like it&amp;#39;s been a terrible stretch for you to find new relationships or meet new women. You don&amp;#39;t seem too tender out of your last longish term relationship, for instance.) This relationship will obviously impact the rest of your lives, no matter what. You know that already, so I won&amp;#39;t recite the implications for you again, but I don&amp;#39;t know if you&amp;#39;ve ever actually experienced that before. In a short while you&amp;#39;ll be living together. Even in otherwise normal relationships, that&amp;#39;s fast. And it&amp;#39;s just more barriers to get past if your feelings about this change.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you truly did read everything in its entirety, then you should know that Ashley and I spent many hours discussing exactly what you said above: What if we break up? What if things change between us? &amp;quot;What ifs&amp;quot; were a major topic of discussion. You seemed to think Ashley was immature and acting like a high schooler, but for times other than a few heated moments (which everyone is entitled to, especially in a situation like ours) she is VERY collected about all this. Believe me, if she was an immature little girl I wouldn&amp;#39;t be into it at all. But she is the opposite of that. She&amp;#39;s got a great head on her shoulders, she knows what she wants and why she wants it, and she isn&amp;#39;t trying to trick herself into thinking this will be easy. She&amp;#39;s been preparing for this, in a way, for longer than most anyone ever could.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You also need to remember that we grew up together in a house where we relied on ourselves and each other because our Mom wasn&amp;#39;t around. And it wasn&amp;#39;t like I was her &amp;quot;father figure&amp;quot; like so many think. We were equals, just trying to get through to the next day and help our Mom by not burdening her more than she already was with all her jobs, etc. We all had to grow up a little faster than we&amp;#39;d probably have liked to, but we came out stronger and more independent because of it. I know you think we would be co-dependant in a bad way as a couple, but really it&amp;#39;s the opposite. I can already tell and we haven&amp;#39;t even moved in together yet. We&amp;#39;re stronger and more complete together. It may sound crazy after only ~3 months, but I truly believe we can work if nothing stupid gets in our way. That&amp;#39;s the only reason I have committed so hard to this path we are heading down. Ashley has said the same thing to me since we started allowing ourselves the freedom to just naturally progress at the speed we feel comfortable with, and because it&amp;#39;s all felt so easy between us the whole time so far, maybe we&amp;#39;ve moved faster than most people would normally be comfortable with. The way we look at it we&amp;#39;ve already been living together, mostly alone, for almost ten years already. I don&amp;#39;t think much will change once we are living together. Removing the possibility of my mom or sister walking in on us, which will be the only REAL difference once we move in together, isn&amp;#39;t going to be something bad, it&amp;#39;s only going to allow us the freedom we truly desire to suss out our relationship even further.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s okay to take risks and try new things, but it sounds like you&amp;#39;re already treating this like a sure thing. But feelings change and life happens, and when they do it&amp;#39;s nice to be able to react and pull back if necessary, and I don&amp;#39;t see where you&amp;#39;ve left yourself room to do that. I believe you guys should talk about slowing down and giving yourselves somewhere to progress to in your relationship, whatever that means for you. If this thing does work out, then you&amp;#39;ve got your whole lives to escalate and expand your relationship to fit what you can accommodate.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wouldn&amp;#39;t say I&amp;#39;m treating it as a sure thing, because nothing in life is guaranteed. I know that from my childhood and parents. But as I mentioned I&amp;#39;m all in on something I commit to. I&amp;#39;m putting every ounce of my being into my relationship with Ashley, because I love her and I want it to work with all of my heart now. I&amp;#39;m sure once we are living together things will slow down a bit. We are moving fast now mostly because this opportunity presented itself and we couldn&amp;#39;t pass it up. I was moving out anyway, and she needed to get into a 4 year school. When the planet&amp;#39;s align and present you with something like this, you don&amp;#39;t turn your nose up at it. I&amp;#39;ve learned at least that much in my time on this planet. Ashley confessing, me accepting my feelings for her, moving into a relationship and then having the perfect opportunity to give our relationship a real chance away from the prying eyes of family and friends is almost too good to be true, and certainly wouldn&amp;#39;t happen again without a lot more work and effort on our part. And we&amp;#39;ve talked about all this and we both know that we are lucky things worked out the way they have (minus the Sarah thing). We know we have a long, most likely hard, road ahead. Ashley especially since she&amp;#39;s been mulling over that for far longer than I have.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Like I said, I&amp;#39;m sorry about my previous tone. I do hope this works out for you two, in the same way I hope all relationships work out. But also, I would venture to say you&amp;#39;ve painted a very different picture with your subtext than you probably have in your conscious mind. I mean, I read stories on this sub all the time, and this is the first one where I picked up on enough red flags that I wanted to comment. Take that for what you will.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Best of luck, and please be careful.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you for the apology, your well wishes, and your time commenting. As always, I appreciate all feedback and I only have good things to say about this sub, despite the &amp;quot;bias&amp;quot; you mentioned. I&amp;#39;ve never had a problem with that bias though because sex and intimacy are part of any relationship and are especially important in a long lasting one. So the inclusion of detailed sexual encounters, at least in the non-fiction posts, I find are helpful to a degree. If people enjoy it enough that they&amp;#39;re able to rub one out before commenting, more power to them I say!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

I certainly didn't mean to come across as needlessly insulting - more just that I read all your posts in one sitting and felt overwhelmed by how many red flags I picked up on, and was frustrated that nobody else seemed to be reading between the lines at all (I'm sure we can soberly acknowledge there is an active bias on this sub). I suppose in my haste to articulate a lot of ideas and attempt to unravel the massive narrative that has taken dominance over the past few months, I forewent careful language. By the time I reached the end of this update, I was about to burst. For that I'll apologize. I'm not your parent, I'm not here to chastise you or insult you. I have, however, lived enough to be able to recognize the way you feel in feelings I've had before.\n\nI think your definition of love is exactly a young person's definition of love. I do not believe that lusting after someone in your school play, kissing them unprompted, and hoping they'll mount you then and there is \"love.\" I think it's what a high schooler thinks love is. Not that we don't need those experiences, because we do. And they are perfectly valid. But I wouldn't build a lifelong foundation with that definition as the framework.\n\nAs I said, I don't think you'll take my advice. I think it'd be hard for you to do so even if you agreed with me at this point. I'm not even sure what you would do to change course now. You're committed on so many levels.\n\nAnd that's a lot of what scares me about your situation. This is not a relationship you can bail from without lasting consequence, like you're used to. (It sounds like you're an attractive charismatic guy, based on what you've said about women approaching you/your last ex being ready for marriage/Ashley saying you treat women like princesses/etc. As such, it doesn't seem like it's been a terrible stretch for you to find new relationships or meet new women. You don't seem too tender out of your last longish term relationship, for instance.) This relationship will obviously impact the rest of your lives, no matter what. You know that already, so I won't recite the implications for you again, but I don't know if you've ever actually experienced that before. In a short while you'll be living together. Even in otherwise normal relationships, that's fast. And it's just more barriers to get past if your feelings about this change.\n\nIt's okay to take risks and try new things, but it sounds like you're already treating this like a sure thing.

I certainly didn&amp;#39;t mean to come across as needlessly insulting - more just that I read all your posts in one sitting and felt overwhelmed by how many red flags I picked up on, and was frustrated that nobody else seemed to be reading between the lines at all (I&amp;#39;m sure we can soberly acknowledge there is an active bias on this sub). I suppose in my haste to articulate a lot of ideas and attempt to unravel the massive narrative that has taken dominance over the past few months, I forewent careful language. By the time I reached the end of this update, I was about to burst. For that I&amp;#39;ll apologize. I&amp;#39;m not your parent, I&amp;#39;m not here to chastise you or insult you. I have, however, lived enough to be able to recognize the way you feel in feelings I&amp;#39;ve had before.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think your definition of love is exactly a young person&amp;#39;s definition of love. I do not believe that lusting after someone in your school play, kissing them unprompted, and hoping they&amp;#39;ll mount you then and there is &amp;quot;love.&amp;quot; I think it&amp;#39;s what a high schooler thinks love is. Not that we don&amp;#39;t need those experiences, because we do. And they are perfectly valid. But I wouldn&amp;#39;t build a lifelong foundation with that definition as the framework.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As I said, I don&amp;#39;t think you&amp;#39;ll take my advice. I think it&amp;#39;d be hard for you to do so even if you agreed with me at this point. I&amp;#39;m not even sure what you would do to change course now. You&amp;#39;re committed on so many levels.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;#39;s a lot of what scares me about your situation. This is not a relationship you can bail from without lasting consequence, like you&amp;#39;re used to. (It sounds like you&amp;#39;re an attractive charismatic guy, based on what you&amp;#39;ve said about women approaching you/your last ex being ready for marriage/Ashley saying you treat women like princesses/etc. As such, it doesn&amp;#39;t seem like it&amp;#39;s been a terrible stretch for you to find new relationships or meet new women. You don&amp;#39;t seem too tender out of your last longish term relationship, for instance.) This relationship will obviously impact the rest of your lives, no matter what. You know that already, so I won&amp;#39;t recite the implications for you again, but I don&amp;#39;t know if you&amp;#39;ve ever actually experienced that before. In a short while you&amp;#39;ll be living together. Even in otherwise normal relationships, that&amp;#39;s fast. And it&amp;#39;s just more barriers to get past if your feelings about this change.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s okay to take risks and try new things, but it sounds like you&amp;#39;re already treating this like a sure thing. But feelings change and life happens, and when they do it&amp;#39;s nice to be able to react and pull back if necessary, and I don&amp;#39;t see where you&amp;#39;ve left yourself room to do that. I believe you guys should talk about slowing down and giving yourselves somewhere to progress to in your relationship, whatever that means for you. If this thing does work out, then you&amp;#39;ve got your whole lives to escalate and expand your relationship to fit what you can accommodate.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like I said, I&amp;#39;m sorry about my previous tone.

Toward the end of our conversation especially she was her normal self and calm. I think me confronting her and her making a split second decision to finally just tell me everything really overwhelmed her at first. She could barely tell me. It's like she was trying to force a bowling ball through a straw.\n\nHer emotions and the way she acted the majority of the time during that talk, and all the times afterwards, were not the actions or emotions of someone who is immature. They were the actions and emotions of someone in love who has been torn for many years about even coming to terms with it, let alone acting on it. Once I allowed her to release those flood gates by confronting her (and I confronted her basically KNOWING already how she felt, so I knew what I was getting into despite my own nativity about how deep her feelings ran) she let her walls down. Crying and being emotional doesn't imply immaturity. And outside of those moments, she was perfectly calm, cool, and collected. And I've said as much many times. In the moment she gets emotional, usually only when her long-held feelings are challenged. Who doesn't get a little emotional in those situations?\n\nAfter almost 3 months of being together I can confidently say that I made the right decision and that the only thing in reality that was REALLY stopping me at the beginning was the fact that it was illegal/taboo, and all the negative stigma and fallout that could occur if the wrong people found out. Plus I had no experience with feelings and relationships for a family member, all I knew of it was the negative stigma attached to it. But Ashley is beautiful, smart, and an amazingly thoughtful person. My posts have not outlined these details of her personality or character because that isn't what I was here to do. I have been here, and continue to be here, because I needed advice on what to do about a sister who jumped in the shower with me and then confessed her undying love to me, and now the resulting relationship that has occurred because of it. Sorry, I'm not writing an autobiography on Ashley. I'm posting the necessary bits for people to be able to help me out with something that I had no experience with (INCEST!). I've been told that I write those bits nicely and it's a good read, which was in no way my original intention. If you'd like me to go into more details about us, our lives, or our personalities outside of the context of what is necessary for these posts, then I'm sorry but you are barking up the wrong tree. If it wasn't implied that I think she is thoughtful, beautiful, and smart, then I suppose this is me screaming it to the world: Ashley is thoughtful, beautiful, and smart, and I love those and every other one of her personality and character traits, good and bad!\n\nWhich leads me to...\n\nYou make it seem as though humans would be better as robots, doing nothing but calculating things in a non-emotional and perpetually logic-only way. I'm sorry, but NOBODY operates like that. Love is a whirlwind of emotion and split second decisions that can go positively or negatively. You are trying to break down our process of figuring out our love for each other (which were two completely different paths that arrived at the same point, against some pretty crazy odds) without all the information and by trying to strip out the human element to love. Especially given the taboo nature of our relationship, I don't see how any of this could have gone logically or non-emotionally. Making impulsive decisions, like her asking to kiss me or me deciding to give in, is just part of the process. Have you ever been in love, or thought you were in love at least? If you've never asked about kissing spontaneously, or did something you may have even KNOWN was not right or \"ok\" in the heat of the moment, or been swayed by someones words when they speak lovingly about you, then you really have no basis for me to try to convey to you why I reacted the way that I did, or why she reacted the way she did.\n\nHere, a perfect example: A girl in high school kissed me randomly during a school play one time. She admitted to me in later years that she was madly in love with me at that time, and was hoping that I was going to throw her to the ground after she kissed me right there on the stage and \"take her\", and then go break up with my girlfriend afterwards. That's what love does to you. It makes you act irrationally and in the moment. Ashley bottled that up for the better part of a decade. Honestly I'm not sure how she kept going as long as she did. And after our first talk it stirred something in me that grew faster and larger than I could have ever imagined. That's not \"manipulation\" or \"immaturity\", that's love!\n\nYou brought up our ages. What do our age have to do with any of this? Maturity has nothing to do with age after a certain point. Obviously 10-year-old Ashley's feelings about me were very immature and unrefined. But her feelings matured and persisted over almost a decade. How is that \"immature\"? If anything those are the most matured and enduring feelings of love I've ever come across in my life.\n\n&gt;You love the idea of someone loving you as much as she does.\n\nUmm... no shit? Of fucking course I do! Do you not love the idea of someone loving you? What the hell is that statement even? I was taken aback by the depth of her love for me. And that helped nurture my growing love for her, but it was only a small part of it. I'm not going to explain to you how love happens, because I don't think anyone really even knows. But please, don't pretend to sit there and 1) Know us or our love in such detail that you can claim it to be false or 2) claim to know the intricate details of WHY I'm attracted or in love with her, and her with me. Again, much of what I wrote is for context so I can get advice on the thing I have no experience with: a relationship with a sibling, dealing with someone finding out, etc. I've already sorted all my feelings out and have now been in love with her and in a relationship for going on 3 months. You're a little late to the party, and you haven't even read the invitation fully it seems. None of what you said has much of anything to do with the \"incest\" aspect, and has more to do with trying to torpedo our feelings and foundation for our relationship. Please, save your breath. We're committed to this and each other. \n\nOne thing I know FOR SURE is that AGE DOES NOT EQUAL MATURITY. Maturity through age is a fallacy. And I can say that confidently because:\n\n1) there are literally millions of people who start dating in high school, sometimes even middle school, and wind up getting married and living perfectly happy, healthy lives with each other, in lasting, emotionally mature relationships. Are you saying that you have to be a certain age to start a mature relationship, and that age is sometime after 18-22? Please, enlighten me and everyone else as to what that age is? I'm sure that the millions of happily married couples out there who met in grade school would like to have a word with you no matter what # you decide on.\n\nand\n\n2) I know sooooo many \"adults\" who are totally fucked and immature. Some of them got lucky despite their immaturity, but many more of them are horrible examples of humanity who are literally just going through the motions in an empty relationship or living out their lives alone and miserable because they lack the maturity to face their own feelings, circumstances, or commitments. It is laughable that you try to throw age up as some kind of deciding factor with regards to the legitimacy of our love or feelings.\n\nIt has been almost 3 months now with Ashley and my feelings for her have only grown, and she has told me that despite her years of love for me they have been growing and changing for her too. Yes, we are \"honeymooning\". But we also have many, many years of familial foundation. We aren't strangers who just met and don't know each other. If anything, we have a HUGE headstart that most do not. So, how can you possibly know where we will be in another 3 months, let along years or longer if we continue to feel this way about each other? Are you some kind of soothsayer or non-fake Miss Cleo? Can you see our future? Because I doubt you can. I definitely love Ashley, and I think I've made it clear in my posts that she loves me (because I know she does, both romantically and because we're family). We are willing to brave this insane world together despite the risks and hurdles we will have to overcome BECAUSE we love each other AND are family. She is not playing some \"fantasy game\", and neither am I. One would think that would be clear from our methodical steps that we've taken to be together and change our circumstances to give our relationship a real chance (long discussions about our feelings and future, honest assessment of the risks involved with life choices we are making, moving out of my mother's house and supporting ourselves, moving in together, you know... normal mature relationship stuff...)\n\nIn closing, I won't be taking any of your advice since it seems that you haven't even bothered to really read through everything I've posted. Your words make it clear that you don't understand love or relationships, especially ours, and have a very warped view of maturity and love in general. The amount of assumption and completely fabricated detail you'd need to create in order to draw your conclusions is, frankly, staggering.\n\nI appreciate you taking the time to write all that out, as I do with all commenters, and I would like to think that your heart was in the right place when you wrote it, but please don't bother with any follow-up as it will fall on deaf ears (or maybe blind eyes would be more apt). Really kind of disappointing that you could be so completely off base after supposedly reading through all of my posts and content.",

Toward the end of our conversation especially she was her normal self and calm. I think me confronting her and her making a split second decision to finally just tell me everything really overwhelmed her at first. She could barely tell me. It&amp;#39;s like she was trying to force a bowling ball through a straw.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Her emotions and the way she acted the majority of the time during that talk, and all the times afterwards, were not the actions or emotions of someone who is immature. They were the actions and emotions of someone in love who has been torn for many years about even coming to terms with it, let alone acting on it. Once I allowed her to release those flood gates by confronting her (and I confronted her basically KNOWING already how she felt, so I knew what I was getting into despite my own nativity about how deep her feelings ran) she let her walls down. Crying and being emotional doesn&amp;#39;t imply immaturity. And outside of those moments, she was perfectly calm, cool, and collected. And I&amp;#39;ve said as much many times. In the moment she gets emotional, usually only when her long-held feelings are challenged. Who doesn&amp;#39;t get a little emotional in those situations?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After almost 3 months of being together I can confidently say that I made the right decision and that the only thing in reality that was REALLY stopping me at the beginning was the fact that it was illegal/taboo, and all the negative stigma and fallout that could occur if the wrong people found out. Plus I had no experience with feelings and relationships for a family member, all I knew of it was the negative stigma attached to it. But Ashley is beautiful, smart, and an amazingly thoughtful person. My posts have not outlined these details of her personality or character because that isn&amp;#39;t what I was here to do. I have been here, and continue to be here, because I needed advice on what to do about a sister who jumped in the shower with me and then confessed her undying love to me, and now the resulting relationship that has occurred because of it. Sorry, I&amp;#39;m not writing an autobiography on Ashley. I&amp;#39;m posting the necessary bits for people to be able to help me out with something that I had no experience with (INCEST!). I&amp;#39;ve been told that I write those bits nicely and it&amp;#39;s a good read, which was in no way my original intention. If you&amp;#39;d like me to go into more details about us, our lives, or our personalities outside of the context of what is necessary for these posts, then I&amp;#39;m sorry but you are barking up the wrong tree. If it wasn&amp;#39;t implied that I think she is thoughtful, beautiful, and smart, then I suppose this is me screaming it to the world: Ashley is thoughtful, beautiful, and smart, and I love those and every other one of her personality and character traits, good and bad!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which leads me to...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You make it seem as though humans would be better as robots, doing nothing but calculating things in a non-emotional and perpetually logic-only way. I&amp;#39;m sorry, but NOBODY operates like that. Love is a whirlwind of emotion and split second decisions that can go positively or negatively. You are trying to break down our process of figuring out our love for each other (which were two completely different paths that arrived at the same point, against some pretty crazy odds) without all the information and by trying to strip out the human element to love. Especially given the taboo nature of our relationship, I don&amp;#39;t see how any of this could have gone logically or non-emotionally. Making impulsive decisions, like her asking to kiss me or me deciding to give in, is just part of the process. Have you ever been in love, or thought you were in love at least? If you&amp;#39;ve never asked about kissing spontaneously, or did something you may have even KNOWN was not right or &amp;quot;ok&amp;quot; in the heat of the moment, or been swayed by someones words when they speak lovingly about you, then you really have no basis for me to try to convey to you why I reacted the way that I did, or why she reacted the way she did.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here, a perfect example: A girl in high school kissed me randomly during a school play one time. She admitted to me in later years that she was madly in love with me at that time, and was hoping that I was going to throw her to the ground after she kissed me right there on the stage and &amp;quot;take her&amp;quot;, and then go break up with my girlfriend afterwards. That&amp;#39;s what love does to you. It makes you act irrationally and in the moment. Ashley bottled that up for the better part of a decade. Honestly I&amp;#39;m not sure how she kept going as long as she did. And after our first talk it stirred something in me that grew faster and larger than I could have ever imagined. That&amp;#39;s not &amp;quot;manipulation&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;immaturity&amp;quot;, that&amp;#39;s love!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You brought up our ages. What do our age have to do with any of this? Maturity has nothing to do with age after a certain point. Obviously 10-year-old Ashley&amp;#39;s feelings about me were very immature and unrefined. But her feelings matured and persisted over almost a decade. How is that &amp;quot;immature&amp;quot;? If anything those are the most matured and enduring feelings of love I&amp;#39;ve ever come across in my life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You love the idea of someone loving you as much as she does.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Umm... no shit? Of fucking course I do! Do you not love the idea of someone loving you? What the hell is that statement even? I was taken aback by the depth of her love for me. And that helped nurture my growing love for her, but it was only a small part of it. I&amp;#39;m not going to explain to you how love happens, because I don&amp;#39;t think anyone really even knows. But please, don&amp;#39;t pretend to sit there and 1) Know us or our love in such detail that you can claim it to be false or 2) claim to know the intricate details of WHY I&amp;#39;m attracted or in love with her, and her with me. Again, much of what I wrote is for context so I can get advice on the thing I have no experience with: a relationship with a sibling, dealing with someone finding out, etc. I&amp;#39;ve already sorted all my feelings out and have now been in love with her and in a relationship for going on 3 months. You&amp;#39;re a little late to the party, and you haven&amp;#39;t even read the invitation fully it seems. None of what you said has much of anything to do with the &amp;quot;incest&amp;quot; aspect, and has more to do with trying to torpedo our feelings and foundation for our relationship. Please, save your breath. We&amp;#39;re committed to this and each other. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One thing I know FOR SURE is that AGE DOES NOT EQUAL MATURITY. Maturity through age is a fallacy. And I can say that confidently because:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1) there are literally millions of people who start dating in high school, sometimes even middle school, and wind up getting married and living perfectly happy, healthy lives with each other, in lasting, emotionally mature relationships. Are you saying that you have to be a certain age to start a mature relationship, and that age is sometime after 18-22? Please, enlighten me and everyone else as to what that age is? I&amp;#39;m sure that the millions of happily married couples out there who met in grade school would like to have a word with you no matter what # you decide on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;and&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2) I know sooooo many &amp;quot;adults&amp;quot; who are totally fucked and immature. Some of them got lucky despite their immaturity, but many more of them are horrible examples of humanity who are literally just going through the motions in an empty relationship or living out their lives alone and miserable because they lack the maturity to face their own feelings, circumstances, or commitments. It is laughable that you try to throw age up as some kind of deciding factor with regards to the legitimacy of our love or feelings.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It has been almost 3 months now with Ashley and my feelings for her have only grown, and she has told me that despite her years of love for me they have been growing and changing for her too. Yes, we are &amp;quot;honeymooning&amp;quot;. But we also have many, many years of familial foundation. We aren&amp;#39;t strangers who just met and don&amp;#39;t know each other. If anything, we have a HUGE headstart that most do not. So, how can you possibly know where we will be in another 3 months, let along years or longer if we continue to feel this way about each other? Are you some kind of soothsayer or non-fake Miss Cleo? Can you see our future? Because I doubt you can.

I'll attempt to address everything you said, but I really find myself disagreeing with most of what you wrote, so I will attempt to not drag this out into a 40,000 character monster. No promises though. (Edit: 10000 character limit on comments? WTF reddit. Two replies it is.)\n\nI'll overlook most of the direct insults to us and try to get to the core of what you said, although some of what you said wasn't very nice. I will say in response to this: \n\n&gt;It just so happens that you two are about the worst couple I could possibly imagine\n\nthat your imagination is apparently not very good.\n\nFirst, lets get this out of the way right up front, my posts are not fiction. I'm living this shit in real time, and I've already stated that several times before, if you'd taken the time to actually read everything which it is clear you haven't (or at the very least you completely missed entire posts or comment replies). So that's all I'll say about that.\n\nNext, I'd like to say that the advice that I've received here on /r/incest has helped me really slow down and think about a lot of things, especially early on. Obviously you didn't read all the advice I received. Go back and read it if you care to fill the gaps in your understanding here. There was some really deep stuff in there, especially in Update 1, that made me take way longer than I probably would have without it to decide on things. I mean, I started a post with:\n\n&gt;Because of the content of the advice that I got on here, I took much longer really thinking about what would be the right thing to do with regards to Ashley. I received a lot of feedback that really twisted me up inside and made me doubt how to move forward.\n\nI then detailed what those things were. Seriously, did you even read all of my posts, or did you just skim it and then just start writing your comment without really knowing what I wrote? You couldn't even get the basic details right:\n\n&gt;I wish I had been on here a few weeks ago when your posts started.\n\nIt's been more than 2 months since my first post.\n\nMost of what you said seems like you were cherry picking stuff out to fit your narrative of what is going on. Here is a perfect example:\n\n&gt;[Sarah] understands healthy relationships (**I'm assuming** -- she has kids), and taboo relationships\n\n\"Assuming\" is certainly what you were doing in a lot of your comment. Just because I like Sarah and think she's a good/fun person doesn't mean that I agree with what she's done in her life. I've left Sarah's personal details and history out of these posts because there is no reason for anyone to know them and I have no desire to spend the time that would be required to change them so that they wouldn't be easily linked to her in real life. Needless to say, you literally know almost nothing about Sarah (and, in reality, you don't know much more about myself or Ashley either) beyond the tiny details I've given in these posts. Sarah had a pretty tragic early life since she got pregnant in highschool, broke up with her boyfriend after a falling out (these are details I did post, which you obviously missed), and several other things I can't and won't repeat for the sole benefit of proving you wrong. She has made, in my opinion, nothing but mistakes with regards to her relationships (past and present) and continues to live an awkward, in-between life where she refuses to actually take the plunge into marriage with her current girlfriend for ridiculous reasons. She says she has a \"fiance\" but in reality she has no real plans to marry her. She had to grow up, forcibly, because she had a kid to take care of and my Mom had enough on her plate after my father left, having to support all of us. Sarah has a very negative outlook on love, relationships, and in particularly men in general (which includes me) due to her own negative experiences (which were all her own fault) and our father leaving. She never finished school because she dropped out to take care of her kid, which is all well and good but she pays for it now in many regards. And I doubt she really learned from her experiences, and the only thing that has keeps her in check is that she does love her daughter and she does want the best for her, at least in spirit. You're assuming way too much when it comes to her. I love her, and I support her because she's family, but that doesn't mean I agree with what and how she did/does things, or her outlook on love and relationships especially.\n\n&gt;Ashely is (if my math is right) 18 years old. While she may 'legally' be an adult, she is fresh out of high school. She barely knows how to take care of herself, and does not know how to take care of you, or be responsible for the semi-permanent decisions and lifelong repercussions you two are full on sprinting towards. And at 22, you're really not all that much better. I'll elaborate:\n\nNo need to elaborate. I lived through all that, remember? First, you also apparently missed several other things:\n\n1) The years of Ashley agonizing over the ramifications, potential negative repercussions, and the more-than-likely negative fallout from evening ADMITTING to her feelings, let alone actually acting on them.\n\n2) Me taking many weeks/days to think things through, between every development of her confessing to me and our relationship starting, and not rushing into anything. \n\n3) The long, hard discussions after deciding to move forward with this relationship about how hard it would be, the difficulties, and the things we'd have to do to try to avoid negative fallout.\n\n4) Waiting 2+ months to have sex and decide to move in together, thereby moving the relationship into a more serious place.\n\nAgain, did you even read all of my posts, comment replies, etc? I swear, it seems like you just read the cliffs notes and are now are trying to ace the test. Not that it really matters, but Ashley is 19 currently. I'd like to also point out that you are assuming a lot there about Ashley (which is a theme in your post: assumption). How do you know these things about her? It's amazing that you can know that she doesn't know how to \"take care of me\" because she doesn't know how to \"take care of herself\". Again, I swear you didn't read anything. Or maybe you just have selective memory? I said our father left at an early age. And our mother worked 2, sometimes 3 jobs, to make ends meet. I didn't say this specifically in my posts because I figured it would be obvious, but apparently I need to spell it out for you: we raised OURSELVES. My Mom barely had time to sleep, let alone do anything for us. We did almost everything for ourselves, especially for the few years right after my dad left and things were really hard, and when Sarah was going through all her really bad shit. Ashley and I raised ourselves, cared for ourselves, and did what we had to do to survive and be strong for our Mom. You've got a lot of nerve thinking she, or I, are unable to care for ourselves. I'd be willing to put $ on the fact that we had a harder childhood and upbringing than a LOT of kids, and we still turned out fine with no major issues (although Sarah seemed like she might be an exception for a while early on). I'm not going to detail our life stories on here, that is not what I'm here to do. And I wouldn't want those details out there since they'd be too hard to scrub for identifying details. Just know that you were 100%, completely, unequivocally wrong on this.\n\nNow, you also said with regards to her getting into bed after our first chat:\n\n&gt;This is not okay. Nothing that you said signified \"Please take off your clothes and get in my bed.\" It was pure manipulation. And maybe you were considering it, or were conflicted, such that it wasn't unwelcome. But she didn't know that. She just hoped it. If she were operating solely by what you said, she would have given you space. This is the opposite of that.\n\nFirstly, you focused on (see: cherry-picked) that event, yet you *somehow* appear to have missed the next thing I said in reference to it, and Ashley, right in the BEGINNING of the next post:\n\n&gt;I wrestled with that shit back and forth in my head for the better part of 2 weeks. Thankfully Ashley didn't bring up anything or act strangely the whole time.\n\nSince you're making it necessary to expand on that now, I will. She almost completely left me alone for those two weeks. She did nothing like get into bed with me, repeat our kiss from that night, nothing. She didn't even mention what we had talked about, her feelings, etc. She allowed me the time necessary to come to terms with my feelings, ON MY OWN, without her involvement, before confronting her with even more questions/doubts. I even wrestled specifically with several of the things you mentioned (me being the male figure in her life after our father left, etc). Again, you appear to have missed a HUGE part of one of my posts and the followup comments and discussion.\n\n\"Manipulation\" of me would imply that I was somehow duped into something against my will. That she somehow was able to say and do things that slipped by my radar and changed my mind without my knowing. You copying and pasting what I said to her, and it showing that her words had an impact on my decisions and feelings, isn't manipulation. I heard everything she said, and processed it fully. Just because I let it break down my walls against the taboo that is incest, and stirred emotions in me I didn't know I had, doesn't mean I was manipulated. It means I was falling in love and was perfectly fine with the outcome.\n\nAs for Ashley and her feelings/emotions/maturity level, I have addressed this many times as well. Again, just something I guess you missed in your thorough analysis of my posts and our relationship... Here is part of a comment I made on my second post for your reference:\n\nContinued below...",

I&amp;#39;ll attempt to address everything you said, but I really find myself disagreeing with most of what you wrote, so I will attempt to not drag this out into a 40,000 character monster. No promises though. (Edit: 10000 character limit on comments? WTF reddit. Two replies it is.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll overlook most of the direct insults to us and try to get to the core of what you said, although some of what you said wasn&amp;#39;t very nice. I will say in response to this: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It just so happens that you two are about the worst couple I could possibly imagine&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;that your imagination is apparently not very good.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First, lets get this out of the way right up front, my posts are not fiction. I&amp;#39;m living this shit in real time, and I&amp;#39;ve already stated that several times before, if you&amp;#39;d taken the time to actually read everything which it is clear you haven&amp;#39;t (or at the very least you completely missed entire posts or comment replies). So that&amp;#39;s all I&amp;#39;ll say about that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Next, I&amp;#39;d like to say that the advice that I&amp;#39;ve received here on &lt;a href=\"/r/incest\"&gt;/r/incest&lt;/a&gt; has helped me really slow down and think about a lot of things, especially early on. Obviously you didn&amp;#39;t read all the advice I received. Go back and read it if you care to fill the gaps in your understanding here. There was some really deep stuff in there, especially in Update 1, that made me take way longer than I probably would have without it to decide on things. I mean, I started a post with:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Because of the content of the advice that I got on here, I took much longer really thinking about what would be the right thing to do with regards to Ashley. I received a lot of feedback that really twisted me up inside and made me doubt how to move forward.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I then detailed what those things were. Seriously, did you even read all of my posts, or did you just skim it and then just start writing your comment without really knowing what I wrote? You couldn&amp;#39;t even get the basic details right:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I wish I had been on here a few weeks ago when your posts started.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s been more than 2 months since my first post.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Most of what you said seems like you were cherry picking stuff out to fit your narrative of what is going on. Here is a perfect example:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;[Sarah] understands healthy relationships (&lt;strong&gt;I&amp;#39;m assuming&lt;/strong&gt; -- she has kids), and taboo relationships&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Assuming&amp;quot; is certainly what you were doing in a lot of your comment. Just because I like Sarah and think she&amp;#39;s a good/fun person doesn&amp;#39;t mean that I agree with what she&amp;#39;s done in her life. I&amp;#39;ve left Sarah&amp;#39;s personal details and history out of these posts because there is no reason for anyone to know them and I have no desire to spend the time that would be required to change them so that they wouldn&amp;#39;t be easily linked to her in real life. Needless to say, you literally know almost nothing about Sarah (and, in reality, you don&amp;#39;t know much more about myself or Ashley either) beyond the tiny details I&amp;#39;ve given in these posts. Sarah had a pretty tragic early life since she got pregnant in highschool, broke up with her boyfriend after a falling out (these are details I did post, which you obviously missed), and several other things I can&amp;#39;t and won&amp;#39;t repeat for the sole benefit of proving you wrong. She has made, in my opinion, nothing but mistakes with regards to her relationships (past and present) and continues to live an awkward, in-between life where she refuses to actually take the plunge into marriage with her current girlfriend for ridiculous reasons. She says she has a &amp;quot;fiance&amp;quot; but in reality she has no real plans to marry her. She had to grow up, forcibly, because she had a kid to take care of and my Mom had enough on her plate after my father left, having to support all of us. Sarah has a very negative outlook on love, relationships, and in particularly men in general (which includes me) due to her own negative experiences (which were all her own fault) and our father leaving. She never finished school because she dropped out to take care of her kid, which is all well and good but she pays for it now in many regards. And I doubt she really learned from her experiences, and the only thing that has keeps her in check is that she does love her daughter and she does want the best for her, at least in spirit. You&amp;#39;re assuming way too much when it comes to her. I love her, and I support her because she&amp;#39;s family, but that doesn&amp;#39;t mean I agree with what and how she did/does things, or her outlook on love and relationships especially.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Ashely is (if my math is right) 18 years old.

                        "body": "I wish I had been on here a few weeks ago when your posts started. You desperately needed someone to tell you what I'm about to tell you. I really hope that this is just erotic fiction, because if it's nonfiction, jesus christ.\n\nFor starters, you need to recognize a few things about Sarah. Firstly, she is an adult. Secondly, she understands healthy relationships (I'm assuming -- she has kids), and taboo relationships. Thirdly, she is your elder sibling and has an immense natural protective instinct towards you.\n\n**LISTEN TO HER.**\n\nBecause your situation with Ashley is *really* fucked up.\n\nAshely is (if my math is right) 18 years old. While she may 'legally' be an adult, she is fresh out of high school. She barely knows how to take care of herself, and does not know how to take care of you, or be responsible for the semi-permanent decisions and lifelong repercussions you two are full on sprinting towards. And at 22, you're really not all that much better. I'll elaborate:\n\nShe has repeatedly deomonstrated the ability to manipulate your feelings and actions, and transgress your boundaries, through emotional outbursts. Look back to the initial courtship. You had no feelings for her at that point, and repeatedly made attempts to draw boundaries and set limits. She asks to kiss you, you say \"I don't think that's a good idea.\" She starts crying, and you immediately start feeling guilty and break your own rules that you just set. \n\n&gt;Trying to keep my cool, I said \"I feel like that may be a bad idea before we at least talk more...but please know that I'm not saying I don't want to, because-\" The words had barely left my lips when she jumped in my lap, straddling me on the chair. I let out a \"Whoa!\" as she landed on me, which was all I had time for. She grabbed my face, closed her eyes, and kissed me.\n\nYou need to understand that **YOU HAD JUST SAID NO**. Maybe you were internally conflicted, or having doubts, but the point is she had no way of knowing that. You were *in the process of setting a boundary* and she immediately ignored it.\n\nYou started out really well, not overreacting, being sensitive, being the responsible adult in the room. But sitting at the edge of her bed, home alone, in the dark, at night, where she kissed you without your consent, and then you start talking about sex and sexual history, you became confused and impressionable.\n\n&gt;Ashley: \"I've wanted you to hold me while we kissed like this since we were little. I've wanted you here, just like this, for so long. I just want you, like this, all the time! I can't believe I am telling you this... please don't get mad... but I feel like I'm going to explode with happiness right now!\"\n\nHere's where you admit it yourself.\n\n&gt;Hearing her talk like that broke down a lot of walls that I still had in place about all of this being such a taboo. I was speechless for a while. We weren't really resolving anything, but I was learning the depth of her feelings for me and it was blowing me away. The more she talked like that, the more I stopped caring about my inhibitions.\n\nYou were flattered. And repeatedly, that's the thing you emphasize over and over again in your writing. You are \"amazed at the depths of her feelings,\" or you see how earnest she is, and it softens your resolve, now to the point where you have none. You love the idea of someone loving you as much as she does. That's literally the basis of your attraction. You talk about being attracted in moments when you see how much she means something she says, or when she looks satisfied. Aside from those moments, your description of her is not flattering. You call her blubbering, emotional, hysterical. You don't call her smart, or funny, or even thoughtful or kind.\n\nSo far she's ritualistically exploited your desire to satisfy her monolith of you. She cries because her situation is hard, and then when you give ground, it placates her, and you feel less guilty, and you feel like you're helping, and you feel like you're living up to her expectations she has for you.\n\nYou got some really bad advice in the first thread. People were saying that you need to be really careful about how you deal with this because you could 'break' her. But that contradicts her own notion about her being a responsible adult who can make her own choices -- you are **NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR FIXING THIS FOR HER**.\n\nPart of growing up is learning that some fantasies aren't possible. A lot of times that comes in the form of having an experience that at first resembles your fantasy coming true, but then realizing that life is more complicated than that. This will be that experience for the two of you. You missed your opportunity, back in that dark bedroom that felt like a separate world, to stand up, clear your head, and say \"let's talk in the kitchen,\" or \"let's go for a walk and talk about it tomorrow morning.\" You missed the opportunity to let Ashley deal with the fact that this wasn't possible.\n\nBecause I know how good it feels right now. You guys are honeymooning *hard*. And it's taboo, and forbidden, and that makes it sexy and satisfying, and you have a good relationship already, and it's cathartic for her, and it's ego boosting for you. And you guys will have sex twice a day for a solid month when you move in together, and everything will feel perfect.\n\nThat's called being young in a new relationship. It wears off. For most people, when it does, they're left with either the groundwork to do the labor of growing up and figuring out how to make a healthy relationship work without the thrill of novelty, or a learning experience. And it won't be the former for you two.\n\nAnd the reason isn't because you're siblings. It's because she's completely ruled by her emotions, and you're a pushover.\n\nStill don't believe me? Here's another example:\n\n&gt;Me: \"Ash, I'm gonna need a little time to really think about this. My heart has been beating a million miles a second since you told me your real feelings. I want to have a clear head and figure out what I want and give you an honest, clear answer. And I want to do that before we go any further with anything else.\n\nWhat happens next?\n\n&gt;I woke up later in the middle of the night. I was still in my clothes from the day and super groggy. I went to roll over and get up but my hand brushed against something unexpected. I turned over and I could see my sister laying next to me fast asleep.\n\n***This is not okay.*** Nothing that you said signified \"Please take off your clothes and get in my bed.\" It was pure manipulation. And maybe you were considering it, or were conflicted, such that it wasn't unwelcome. But *she didn't know that. She just hoped it.* If she were operating solely by what you said, she would have given you space. This is the opposite of that.\n\nThis is all *in addition* to what you've said yourself about her idolizing you for years, and you being the only male figure in her life.\n\nI don't believe she's being *malevolent*. It just so happens that you two are about the worst couple I could possibly imagine. In a long term relationship, you guys have everything you need to be highly, dangerously codependent.\n\nAnd all of that is BEFORE you add in the fact that this being incest will supply nothing but staggering logistical and social obstacles to both of you for the entire duration of your relationship, and likely for a very very long time after.\n\nGive Sarah some credit. She's been watching this situation for a very long time, and knew a lot of this was coming. She's neutral enough to be objective, but close enough to be personally invested in this turning out well for everyone. She is your ally in this and is smarter than both of you, and you need that because neither you nor Ashley are thinking straight (and you can take your utterly ineffective efforts at hiding this from her as proof of that).\n\nSarah will probably not rat you out. She doesn't really have any good moves here but to let this run its course. And at that point, that's what you'll have to do.\n\nYou may say \"you're wrong!\" or \"Sarah's wrong!\" and probably you'll run off to your new apartment where every day will be a fantasy forever and ever amen. And if you're lucky, your mother won't find out that you and her daughter are loudly fucking in her house with paper-thin walls before you do.\n\nAnd then this will run its course. And you probably won't pull the cord before then. You'd feel too guilty. In your mind, you'd be crushing Ashley, and proving Sarah right. And Ashley won't pull the cord, because she's been putting all her eggs in this basket for half her time on this earth.\n\nSo it may be a while, but my prediction is it'll be you. I imagine you'll realize your feelings don't match Ashley's long term. (How could they? She's been at this for so long.) You'll get working and start adulting, and your kid sister will be at home wanting to play fantasy when you get home every day, and you'll realize you're not that into it. And you'll try to slide out, but there'll be lots of missteps, because she's emotionally unstable. She'll cry and scream. Hopefully there won't be suicide threats, though stronger people have made them over less. And you'll feel tremendous pressure to not disappoint her, and you'll make both of you miserable.\n\nBut I suppose it's possible that one of the commenters here will inadvertently give some miraculous aid in his attempt to guide your narrative more towards his specific kink. After all, who wouldn't trust the long term relationship advice of a group of men with their dicks in their hands?\n\nLike I said, I hope this is fictional smut. Because this scenario belongs in an anime or something, not real life.",

You desperately needed someone to tell you what I&amp;#39;m about to tell you. I really hope that this is just erotic fiction, because if it&amp;#39;s nonfiction, jesus christ.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For starters, you need to recognize a few things about Sarah. Firstly, she is an adult. Secondly, she understands healthy relationships (I&amp;#39;m assuming -- she has kids), and taboo relationships. Thirdly, she is your elder sibling and has an immense natural protective instinct towards you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LISTEN TO HER.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because your situation with Ashley is &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; fucked up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ashely is (if my math is right) 18 years old. While she may &amp;#39;legally&amp;#39; be an adult, she is fresh out of high school. She barely knows how to take care of herself, and does not know how to take care of you, or be responsible for the semi-permanent decisions and lifelong repercussions you two are full on sprinting towards. And at 22, you&amp;#39;re really not all that much better. I&amp;#39;ll elaborate:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She has repeatedly deomonstrated the ability to manipulate your feelings and actions, and transgress your boundaries, through emotional outbursts. Look back to the initial courtship. You had no feelings for her at that point, and repeatedly made attempts to draw boundaries and set limits. She asks to kiss you, you say &amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t think that&amp;#39;s a good idea.&amp;quot; She starts crying, and you immediately start feeling guilty and break your own rules that you just set. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Trying to keep my cool, I said &amp;quot;I feel like that may be a bad idea before we at least talk more...but please know that I&amp;#39;m not saying I don&amp;#39;t want to, because-&amp;quot; The words had barely left my lips when she jumped in my lap, straddling me on the chair. I let out a &amp;quot;Whoa!&amp;quot; as she landed on me, which was all I had time for. She grabbed my face, closed her eyes, and kissed me.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You need to understand that &lt;strong&gt;YOU HAD JUST SAID NO&lt;/strong&gt;. Maybe you were internally conflicted, or having doubts, but the point is she had no way of knowing that. You were &lt;em&gt;in the process of setting a boundary&lt;/em&gt; and she immediately ignored it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You started out really well, not overreacting, being sensitive, being the responsible adult in the room. But sitting at the edge of her bed, home alone, in the dark, at night, where she kissed you without your consent, and then you start talking about sex and sexual history, you became confused and impressionable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Ashley: &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ve wanted you to hold me while we kissed like this since we were little. I&amp;#39;ve wanted you here, just like this, for so long. I just want you, like this, all the time! I can&amp;#39;t believe I am telling you this... please don&amp;#39;t get mad... but I feel like I&amp;#39;m going to explode with happiness right now!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s where you admit it yourself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Hearing her talk like that broke down a lot of walls that I still had in place about all of this being such a taboo. I was speechless for a while. We weren&amp;#39;t really resolving anything, but I was learning the depth of her feelings for me and it was blowing me away. The more she talked like that, the more I stopped caring about my inhibitions.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You were flattered. And repeatedly, that&amp;#39;s the thing you emphasize over and over again in your writing. You are &amp;quot;amazed at the depths of her feelings,&amp;quot; or you see how earnest she is, and it softens your resolve, now to the point where you have none. You love the idea of someone loving you as much as she does. That&amp;#39;s literally the basis of your attraction. You talk about being attracted in moments when you see how much she means something she says, or when she looks satisfied. Aside from those moments, your description of her is not flattering. You call her blubbering, emotional, hysterical. You don&amp;#39;t call her smart, or funny, or even thoughtful or kind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So far she&amp;#39;s ritualistically exploited your desire to satisfy her monolith of you. She cries because her situation is hard, and then when you give ground, it placates her, and you feel less guilty, and you feel like you&amp;#39;re helping, and you feel like you&amp;#39;re living up to her expectations she has for you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You got some really bad advice in the first thread.

I am actually up at our new place now. I started moving in already. Ashley still has classes at her current college until later this year. Once she finishes class, she is going to move in wiith me over her winter break. Then she is going to resume class at the new college near our new place in the Spring.

You also accepted the challenges and are known as the reasonable one Haha. Sounded like you thought about it, once that wall of seeing a title broken in your case just a sister, and recognize and acknowledge them as just a woman. Then a seed planted of knowing she had that wall knocked down long before. You said she was your physical type, I'm sure subconsciously those hints she threw was her way of releasing a fair bit of tension but as if it was a girl you knew outside of family you would pick up on all of it definitely, also you mentioned once that mental block that society has placed that causes this struggle was broken you started remembering some of those small tiny things she did. \n\nThe only thing wrong with your relationship is the fact other people are stupid enough to believe what the crowd does. It's like the oh God hates me or my baby will be a defected one. You checked the internet they used to write books articles and pawn off research that normally either lies, over exaggerated or worst case scenario. They have it for transgenders. They talk about us as being cured the same as anorexic people. Drugs and therapy. Same as gay people and the poor children that are forced even today into camp violence over being trans or gay, beating them. \n\nRelated relationships have been a thing for longer than it has been considered not, honestly they have genetic tests for woman I hear that would cause abnormalities in birth with related births. They seem to think a brother and sister raising children will cause them to follow that same path as with same sex couples. A lot of European countries don't even care. German and England were the worst for forcing the expectations of this in the families mainly wealthy families. But they use the fact of generations of related birth as a foundation of saying this is what happens. As a continued line forms genetic mutation. Just like twins, one cell breaks into two and if your lucky they come out ok. \n\nTwins in Asia and Germanic society used to marry twins as did the English. They all had different ideas like Asian areas used to think that twins had sex in the womb and that originally in the beginning were born of the same bamboo stalk.\n\nI have always read that when you're in a relationship with a sibling that the intamacy is like nothing you could ever feel with any body else. Also reading the stories of people suffering for years after they try and something happens and they freak out end up miserable and both married then divorced and finally getting together later down the road. People say it can cause others pain, all I read is once it's their and you turn your back to it. It causes you and others pain, accepting it brings change people hate change and always think they know what is best for others. \n\nYou mentioned everything and researched probably trying to scare yourself from choosing something you already made your mind up on in the shower problem, you said scared not disgusted. So you probably already knew the answer but we always have to justify it. Like people get sick in the stomach after talking to a person for lets say an hour and find out they are gay lol all I can think when that stuff happens is A Clockwork Orange. Things change slowly, as most humans are unable to take big change, can put them in a mental state of shock. Like a cut or bullet hole. Their brain convinces them they are dieing and have a heart attack. I wish I could find you a post I found that explained some interesting views. \n\nI feel she will get upset easily knowing it is the beginning of something she thought was impossible to pursue but snapped leading to something you both worked hard for in possible danger, in such early stages of it all. Like you probably wouldn't feel it as strong but it's great you can emphasize how her position stands. Fuck being head over for someone and living with them watching them as they go out with different people bringing them home I would loose it. It is exactly like the manga I read lol it was roll reversed and they were a step siblings but in England in 2003 they made that even illegal. But Japan only some look down on it. But the manga was a good one at the end was probably the best. Just remember the good must balance the bad. It is just it goes. Also there are is a massive amount of related relationships, but once you both move out and can go in public and be relaxed without having to worry. Your both adults and you both accepted each other over what other people think. Just don't stress over events that can't be helped, don't show dissolve in your choices, don't let people put that wall up on you again. She seems like nothing could put that wall up on her but you. Be strong. \n\nOff note I rather read something that explains what it happening, its amazing that you explain what is needed. Also how long do you have to wait for her to move in. If you said early spring isn't that like next year like 5 months away. 5 months, and 4-5hrs away that will be a heavy long distance relationship for a couple in what they call the honeymoon phase. I read its called the honeymoon as after a couple were married they would lock themselves away in their house and drink lots of mead and have lots of sex right up to the next full moon. I think it was at the end of one to the rise of the next thus honey is made into mead which is hard to find good stuff these days and then the moon. Later known as the honeymoon. Then the two would return to there work. \n\nWell sounds like nothing could split you two up, unless you allow it. \n Like gay people hate trans and then you get mix race couple that would kick their child out for being gay. Even though that was only a thing still really freshly accepted. As mix race is worse than being gay if I remember the king James. Also remember two daughters rapping their drunk dad in a cave. Or the city that would have men enter under the conditions of being bummed or something. Sorry if I said anything wrong. But my hate towards the way people react is gross and then attempt all types of miss facts About everything, God, weddings, naturally wrong because they are totally wildlife in your eyes -___- or birth. All which they haven't a clue about any of it. ",
