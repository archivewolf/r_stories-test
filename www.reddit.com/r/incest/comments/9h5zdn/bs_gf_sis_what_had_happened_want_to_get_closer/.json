But that never happened, I remembered \u201cbaby steps are your friend\u201d so I accepted that nothing was going to happen today. Dinner was almost ready so we all went towards the dinner table, as I\u2019m leaning over the table she slides her finger slowly all around my back as she walked by. Cutie played it off and kept walking around setting plates she then glances at me and smiles softly. I think to myself \u201chow do I keep this going\u201d I then walk to her and start playfully poke her (it\u2019s a thing we all do) but I did it under her boobs testing the waters. She looks up at me then giggles and runs away. Oh forgot to mention she wasn\u2019t wearing a bra either. After that we had dinner as we were ready to leave standing by prolonging the late drive home all of a sudden she goes down and grabs my leg trying to flip me over or idk it was all of a sudden, her head right next to my penis (instantly aroused me) I had to think quickly so I started poking her but mid poke I would open my hand and feel her boobs with each poke I felt then more and more, they we\u2019re so soft through her shirt but I did it quickly enough so no one could notice because she LITERALLY did this infront of everyone this probably went on for maybe 2 minutes then she stopped and gave up she was laughing and she looks up at me and all I can think of is \u201cthat\u2019s probably the way she looks at you when she\u2019s sucking.... \u201c yeah I left quickly after with a hard on thinking about seeing her again on how I would get physical with her again how I could maybe playfully slap her butt as she rarely does to me on random occasions i usually give her a whoa and look at her now that we are getting closer the next time she does it I\u2019m gonna do it right back and see how she likes it ;) thanks for reading will update on next mild or wild encounter!",
