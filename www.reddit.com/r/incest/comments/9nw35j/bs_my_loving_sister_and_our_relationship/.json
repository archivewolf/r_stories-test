She was a great mom, and both my sister and I loved her very much. Our dad is still around but he wasn't a great guy. We just don't talk much, nothing in common, nothing good to talk about. \n\nShortly after mom died, my sister and I moved into a mother in law cabin on a farm. We work out there, and the owners don't know that we are related so I'm going to keep details about our farm life sparse. (Also I've seen how this board goes, and there will be no photographs offered or shared.)\n\nYou can call my sister Fields. \n\nI'm 37 and she's 39. Our attraction to each other has been nearly life long. It happened so organically I never even thought too much about it. She was washing dishes and I felt the urge to put my arms around her and she leaned back into me. Fields looked up at me and smiled. I'll never forget that gorgeous smile, I swear to God. I kissed her then, and she turned around in my arms. \n\nWe took it slow, dating as a couple would. She's short and thin, and she has the smallest tits I've ever encountered, and I love them. I love putting them in my mouth, and I love her huge nipples. \n\nSince we do farm work, we are both pretty lean, but I wouldn't say I'm a model of handsomeness or anything, haha. But I'm strong enough to pick her up and hold her against the wall when she wants me to be a little rough. \n\nNeither of us ever wanted kids. So I got a vasectomy at 32, and never looked back. She takes some kind of birth control, just for medical reasons so I'm free to cum in her pussy as much as I want to. \n\nI love Fields so much. She means everything to me. When I wake up and she's in my arms, murmuring sleepy words, I feel like I'm in heaven. Fields is the only woman for me. \n\nWe have a younger sister and she doesn't know about us, at least I don't think. She does her own thing and leaves me and Fields alone. \n\nI'm happy to answer any questions if anyone wants to ask about my relationship with Fields! ",
