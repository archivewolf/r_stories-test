And I feel responsible for obvious reasons, and I dunno what to do. I kinda wanna just tell her what's happening but... that would be really really weird for a million reasons.

I think it'd be hot if he got what he wanted, idk. Maybe that's inhibiting me from thinking of a good solution, idk. So actually, is there a different way I should be approaching this?
