It's always stayed as a fantasy but recently it's just gotten to a point where I can't stand it anymore.\n\nI know that my feelings for her won't be reciprocated and neither am I expecting it to. She's married to a horrible husband (my mother's brother) who constantly abuses her everyday.\n\nMy feelings sort of faded after I left for university. But when I came back for a few days it just came back to me when she kept asking me why I didn't just study in the city that we live in (she lives a couple of miles away from my family) and she became really handsy. I've honestly never seen her do that before but then again maybe I'm just misinterpreting it. She's never physically touched me before until recently. She's always complimented me but she's never really treated anyone else the same way she's treated me. Not even her own children. Maybe I'm just blinding myself to the fact that she may just be really affectionate towards me (like a mother to her child) and I'm just misinterpreting that as her showing interest in me.\n\nWhat makes me feel guilty is the fact that even though I may want something to come out of this, it may never. She may not want it. Idk anymore. I really just want to blurt out my feelings for her but I'm not sure she'll take it the right way. I kinda just wanna tell her so that it's a weight of my chest but I just don't know anymore. Even after writing down all of this, I have such a strong urge to just tell her how I feel. I'm confused and needing help. She's just so thoughtful and kind and I want to do what's best for her. Again maybe I'm just misinterpreting everything.
