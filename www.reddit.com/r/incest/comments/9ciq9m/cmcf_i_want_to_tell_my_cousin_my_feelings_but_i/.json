I&amp;#39;ll be sure to give out more details so others can give me ideas on what to do. If you been in my situation like you said, what should I do since telling someone about how i feel about them is a stupid method because I actually want something to happen... going out with that person... or just do it... or perphas both..! :)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

I\u2019ve been in your situation before, so I know exactly what kind of agony you\u2019re dealing with.\n\nAs you can imagine, situations like these are extremely delicate and things can go horribly wrong if you mess up. It\u2019s important to be cautious when pursuing something like this and to consider all the information available before you take action.\n\nWhich brings us to reason why you aren\u2019t getting much replies. I\u2019ve read all your posts twice, and though I have a pretty good grasp on how YOU feel, I only have the faintest clue about how she feels. I understand that you two are close, but I don\u2019t understand how that closeness manifests itself, if you get what I mean. \n\nDo you two hang out all the time? Are you two particularly touchy-feely? Does she tell you things that she wouldn\u2019t tell anyone else? I can give you more: Does her face light up when she notices you enter a room for the first time? Is she comfortable talking to you about relationships and sex? Have you ever made her uncomfortable by accidentally getting too intimate?\n\nThese are just some of the things to look out for when trying to understand how a person feels about you. You can probably think of more. But if you can answer these questions at least, then I\u2019m sure more people would be willing to help. A lot of us just aren\u2019t sure what you actually need.\n\nPS: Reread that reply on your first post. The guy there had a lot of good stuff to say. I wouldn\u2019t recommend making a move yet though. Bluntly telling someone how you feel is a method I personally despise in any relationship, let alone an incest one, but some people have managed to make it work.",
