She asked him to take the garbage out before they get bugs in the house and then she opened the microwave and saw he left some crap in there from last night when he microwaved old pizza and she kind of went nuts and screamed at him. He screamed back at her, they screamed at each other and he ended up storming out, he slammed the back door so hard he broke the glass.\n\nMy mom sipped her coffee and leaned on the counter and said she was so pissed at him. I said I saw that. She said they tried fucking last night and he didn't get very hard (which he blamed on her not sucking his dick) and then she didn't cum and he refused to go down on her. For reference my mom has never talked to me about sex before the handjob.\n\nI was too nervous to say anything like sexually aggressive so I said sounds like a problem. She said she hated his \"wood problems\" and I just said I didn't have that problem. She said I would someday. I said \"did I have wood problems last week?\"\n\nShe got pissed and told me not to talk about that. She said she still felt guilty. I said there was nothing to be guilty about, I was into it. She said yeah well just keep it to yourself. I said my lips are sealed, unless you want them to be open. She blushed and then got pissed and said it isn't happening again and she told me to find a girlfriend. Then she left without saying goodbye.\n\nDo you guys think I still have a chance at getting anywhere? I wish I had told her I'd love to make her cum, I'm worried she thought I was asking for another handjob. But it went so fast and I was anxious.",
