Using a burner account and email for obvious reasons. I am currently 21 just so everyone knows I'm not breaking rules.  \n\n\nI had always known I was into older women ever since I started being interested in girls. When I discovered porn, my most common searches quickly became stuff like \"mature, hot mom, teacher,\" etc. The hot mom one in particular always stuck out to me. I was addicted to Naughty America's \"My Friend's Hot Mom\" series and then I went even further and got into the whole \"step-mom fetish\" thing or whatever you'd call it. Eventually, that evolved into a lot of hentai involving incest. I think a lot of you reading could probably already see where this is going. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've been on this whole \"self discovery\" kind of thing for the last 3 years or so. I've been meditating a lot and looking within my own mind to find answers to certain aspects of my personality that I don't quite understand. During this time, I began really dissecting a lot of my own fetishes and kinks to try and figure out the core of where they came from. I found that a majority of them went back to my mom or had something to do with how I was raised. This became incredibly obvious to me once I realized how much my own wife has in common with my mom. I found that this was not uncommon for most people so that helped me kinda rationalize it I guess. However, once I realized that a majority of my sexual interests came from my mom, it totally changed the way I looked at her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEventually it all kinda came to a head and one night while \"taking care of things\" I found that the image of my mother had begun to creep into my fantasies. This weirded me out at first but as it kept recurring I became more and more comfortable with it. It's gotten to the point that having sex with my own mother has become a regular fantasy for me and I think about it multiple times in a given week. My mom has been through three different divorces, two of which I have witnessed, and last year she was attempting to get back into the dating scene but gave up due to several bad experiences. My mom and I have a pretty close relationship (if you couldn't tell) and she'll often go on these long rants to me about whatever's bothering her currently. She ranted quite a bit about her problems with guys during that time and, by the end of it, told me that she was probably out of the age range where dating was a viable solution for her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSince then, I feel like she's become increasingly lonely. She doesn't really have a lot of friends or anything and she never goes out aside from family stuff like dinner or a movie. The only people she actually \"hangs out with\" in most cases are me, my wife, and my brother (mostly my brother since me and my wife are often busy with adult life as well). However, as my brother reaches adulthood himself and seeks jobs and places to live besides my mom's house, it's become increasingly obvious how lonely my mom is. She has broken down crying to me before in regards to my brother moving out. I doubt me having sex with her would actually help but I have this illusion in my head that it would (some sort of \"give her what she needs\" mentality).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe issue is, my mom has serious trust issues. I won't go into it for the sake of her privacy, but pretty much her entire life has given her reason to be on edge and suspicious of people all the time. It's not healthy but I doubt she can change it about herself at this point. A lot of people have taken advantage of my mom and walked all over her like a doormat. Our family had to deal with a very abusive person for a solid 5 or 6 years and his actions have greatly effected all of us in some way or another. With that in mind, and knowing everything else I know about my mom, I feel like if I tried to ask her about the idea of having sex or tried to pursue this fantasy in any way beyond my own mind, it would more than likely ruin our relationship and she may never talk to me again. I really don't want that to happen.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, sorry for the wall of text. I just needed to get this off my chest since it's been bothering me for a while and I figured venting anonymously in a place with like-minded individuals would be the best way to go about it.",

But more importantly I have deeply reflected and meditated on what sex and sexuality and sexual relationships are really all about. To begin with sex is an extremely powerful thing; it is much more than \"pleasure\" as it is often described. It is perhaps the most powerful force in nature.  It literally has the power to catapult people into another dimension. In my work and research, it is obvious that incest is not necessarily destructive. It depends on a whole host of other factors. If the foundation is healthy, then a relationships between a mother and son can be not only positive but indeed consciousness raising and evolutionary and indeed healing; powerfully healing. A sexual relationship with your mother could really help her break through the psychological barriers which are present in her and it could be awakening to you as to the depth of being and existence; a revelation !",
