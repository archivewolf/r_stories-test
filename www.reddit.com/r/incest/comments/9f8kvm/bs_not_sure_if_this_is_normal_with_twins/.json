I read the rules and feel like this fits.\n\nfor story, I have a twin sister whom I love very dearly, I would do anything for her. I treat her child as if she was mine. I've loved her for years. I'm not sure if it's the fact that she's a female equivalent or what. I would kill for her.\n\nSo, two nights ago I slept with my first tinder date. I know how stupid that sounds. I had spent a few days working on that, she bought me drinks and made me pho. I fucked her for waaaay too long. I did not come. I had a wet dream as a full fledged adult, I'm 25. I woke up cumming inside my sister in my dream. I messaged her right away, she asked me how it's going and everything. She told me about a weird panic attack she had at the store. I was so glad she messaged me back right away.\n\nWe were a little old to be bathing together, sleeping together, discovering life together. She is responsible for almost all of my first sexual experiences. All she had to do was say the word and her friends would show me their tits, even fuck me when we got a little older. The only problem is I just want to fuck her, flowers in the attic style. This last hook up of mine showed it to me. I wished her one nipple piercing was on my sissy. she knows my feelings on everything. I got physical with her about a year ago. I got weird while hanging out with her and put my hand up her shirt. She responded like I thought she would, confused and worried but calm.\n\nMy question is should I continue? I might be cursed.",
