We have been texting and she has been calling me regularly about school and life. \n\nIt\u2019s great to know that she is doing so well and that our activities haven\u2019t changed her outlook on me. \n\nFast forward:\nI plan on going to see her over a weekend that her mom and I agreed upon being able to spend time together. I\u2019m getting a hotel by her mother\u2019s place. \n\nI\u2019m wondering how I bring it up again since we haven\u2019t really talked about it since that time? I\u2019m going to also be asking her if she is still is interested in me that way?\n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school and I\u2019m about to ask my crush if she likes me back. I know she loves me as a father but I wonder if she is still attracted to me as a lover since we haven\u2019t really talked about it since that last time. \n\nAny advice and questions to clarify are welcome. \nWickr: sameusername\n",
