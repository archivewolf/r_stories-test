She told me that she needed to see me as soon as possible and of course I went over right away. She came out to my car and asked me to drive around the city so that we could talk, she\u2019s currently in the process of moving so her house is almost nonexistent, and she began to explain how her and her children\u2019s father had separated for good. She confessed to me that I was the only person in her life that she wanted to be around, and without me she would be completely alone. \n\nWe drove around for about two hours, eventually moving away from the topic of her relationship and started reminiscing about our childhood together, talking about how close we once were and how we should go back to being that close. Eventually we brought the conversation to present day and she asked what I was going to be doing for my birthday, as it\u2019s quickly approaching. I jokingly asked her what she would be getting me for my birthday, and she offered to take me out for drinks and a \u201cgood time\u201d, when I tried to have her elaborate what she meant by \u201cgood time\u201d she got embarrassed and quickly changed the subject.\n\nThroughout the car ride I complimented her appearance, and my hand naturally came to rest on her thigh. As soon as I realized I was doing it I apologized but she put her hand on top of mine and told me that it was fine to leave it there. \n\nAs I approached her house she told me that she wanted us to see each other more, and we made plans to meet up at her house again this week. She gave me a kiss on the cheek as she got out of the car, which she\u2019s never done before, and proceeded to head back inside.\n\nOnce I got home she sent me a Snapchat saying she had a nice time talking to me, that she missed me, and that she wished we could have spent longer together.\n\nBasically, what I\u2019m asking is, what should my next move be? Step up the physical contact? Get drunk with her and see where the night may go? Or simply continue to be the supportive person in her life she can spend time with.\n\nAny and all advice would be welcome!",
