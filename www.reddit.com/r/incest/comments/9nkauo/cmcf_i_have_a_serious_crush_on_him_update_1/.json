I have to tell this to someone. But right now, I don't feel like I have anyone that I can do it, so I'm posting this here.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've been texting him a lot more on the last weeks, trying to \"get in his mind\" sending texts with selfies about what I'm doing and asking him to do the same. But nothing very risky yet.\n\nBut, I decided to make some serious moves.\n\nThis friday is a holiday where we live. So invited myself to a sleepover on his home on the thursday.\n\n\"How bout speending the night putting some series up to date? Or maybe playing something?\"\n\n\"Sure, sounds good, I'll be home probally after 22.\"\n\nThat was it. But before that, I had to \"survey the place\". He still lives with his mother, my aunt, saving money to buy his own house.  My younger cousin, his brother, also lives there. My family has a spare key to his house and vice-versa, in case of an emergency. So I grabbed that key and decided to go earliear that evening to acess the situation.\n\nI put on tight yoga pants and babylook shirt, burned almost all my allowance on a whisky I know he loves and got to his house. I arived there about 20:00, my aunt was there. His brother would be out all night at a party and she would also leave soon to a trip with her friends.\n\nShe was eating some snacks before leaving. I asked if she minded if I cooked something for us for when he arrives. She told me to go ahead.\n\nWe made some small talk while I started cooking, untill she asked me:\n\n\"So how about the boys, are you seeing someone now?\"\n\nMe and her had already talked on other occasions about how handsome her son is and she always seemed to feel quite prideful about it,  so I felt comfortable with a little joke.\n\n\"Why would I go after anyone, if the best one lives here? Hehehe...\" I said mockingly.\n\nBut the way she stared at me. That serious look on my aunt's eyes. I felt like: \"SHIIIIT. I fucked it all\"\n\nOur family is quite conservative, my aunt is kinda the \"black sheep\", beeing the more open minded between my grandparents and my dad. But even so she still quite conservative.\n\n\"You like him, don't you?\" She changed her tone, gooing from casual to serious.\n\n\"Of course! He's my cousin and...\" I tried to keep the playful tone when she interrupted me.\n\n\"You know what I'm talking about. Me and your mother already noticed it. Even after all those years, you still try to spend any free time with him. The way you look at him, even at family gatherings, always by his side whenever you can...\" She got up and stood by my side as I was chopping food and placed a hand on my shoulder. \"...although I don't find it to be very healthy to any of you...\" She breathed and sighed. \"...I believe you should go for it, try it out. Your mother thinks the same. But, seriously, you should go after other boys your age.\" She grabbed her things and started moving towards the door. \"Okay then, I'm going out, goodnight and...\" Again that heavy sighing \"...take care of him.\"\n\nI was paralyzed, terrified even, for some time. So many things going trough my mind that moment. But then I realized: I had the \"blessing\" of his mother to do it. That was it, that was a sign.\n\nI got back to making dinner. I was almost finished when he arrived. I rushed to the door when I heard the keys on the door. He was getting back from the gym, sweatshorts and tight tank top. I hugged him tightly. He kissed me in the forehead and pushed me back.\n\n\"Hey there. I'm all sweaty, let me at least take a bath.\"\n\nI let him go. On the way he asked about his mom and brother and complimented the smell of the food.\n\n\"They have already left. And thanks, It will be done in some minutes, I'll be waiting for you. Don't take long.\" And gave him a little wink.\n\nSoon we were having dinner. We had some small talk while eating, then I showed him the whisky I bought.\n\n\"Hah. Thanks, you read my mind.\"\n\nI took just a little sip. He drunk almost half the bottle. Actually, I made him stop, I wanted him just a little tipsy, not full blown drunk.\n\nThen we got to his room and sit on his bed to watch something. We started by watching some animes. (Yeah, we are a couple of weeaboos). I asked him if could massage me: \"My calfs ands thighs are sooo sore, I've been bike riding too much.\" We were always very close and \"touchy\" so it was not that strange. I laid on my belly and he started massaging my legs. He started by my feet and made his way up, I started moaning, getting more louder as he got his hands up my legs. I was hopping for him to grope my ass, but he stopped by my thighs.\n\nAfter that and a couple episodes of Hinamatsuri, I asked if I could play a little on his video game. I wanted him to give some tips on Bloodbourne, that I never got the hang of it. At first he sat by my side, but then I created some courage to go trough with my plan. I got up and sat on his lap. \"That way is easier for you to guide me!\" He's quite tall, he's 1,85m, I'm 1,62m (6'1 and 5'3 in armpit measures), so I kinda \"sank in\" his lap, his head above mine.\n\nI started wiggling around on his lap as I played. I could feel his erection against my butt, and I have to admit, it also made me quite horny. I was even worried that he could fell how wet I was getting.\n\nAt first he tried to be serious and teach me how to play, but after some time he started getting kinda embarrassed.\n\nHe then said: \"Well is getting late and, seriously, It has been a long day for me. If you wanna keep playing, feel free, but I will get some sleep. You can sleep on mom's bed if you wanna...\"\n\nIt had been since I was 11 that I din't slept together with him, since then, always we had a sleep over, he or I would sleep on the couch, depending on whose house was the sleepover. But not this time.\n\n\"Can't I sleep here? I'm also kinda tired. And if I sleep on her bed, it will just be another bed to make tomorrow... You know, we aren't horny teenagers anymore? What's the worse could happen, right?\"\n\n\"Yeah, I guess you're right...\"\n\nSo,  after years, we went to bed together. He took of his shirt. It was not uncommon for me to see him shirtless, but the sight of that toned body always makes me all tingly...\n\nAt first we laid facing each other and said goodnight. Wasn't long and he was asleep. So I took my chance and spooned against him, put his arm around me and started wiggling my but against his crotch, feeling if I could get another reaction from him. I don't know if he was asleep and it was just his normal reaction to it, but he held me closer, embracing me and again I felt his hard member against my butt.\n\nI was on fire, I couldn't sleep, I wanted to at touch myself there, feeling his body against mine, but I controlled myself.\n\nOn the middle of the night, he was till snuggling me, and I woke him up as gently as I could.\n\n\"Hey... Heyyyy... are you wake?\"\n\n\"Hmmmmmm....\"\n\n\"Is that a yes?\"\n\n\"Yeah\"\n\n\"Wanna go on a date with me tomorrow?\"\n\n\"Ahn? Date? Sure...\"\n\n\"A real date, like, a couple?\"\n\n\"Sure... Whateves... Just let me sleep now...\"\n\nMy hearth was racing, my mind was wondering everywhere and I couldnt get much sleep last night.\n\nI woke up first in the morning and made us breakfast.\n\nI took it to his bed. He was kinda hungover from last night. I grabbed the spoon and took it to his mouth and feed him. I created courage and asked:\n\n\"So, you remember what you promised last night?\"\n\n\"The date thing?\"\n\n\"Yeah... The date... thing.\"\n\n\"Sure.\"\n\n\"So, are you ok with it? Werent you just saying that to make go back to sleep?\"\n\nHe then put the bowl down, grabbed me by my chin and kissed me. I felt like I was melting. It was finally happening. He stopped and looked me in the eyes.\n\n\"I know you. I've always knew you. I know what you're felling. I always suspected it. And I want it too, you're my favorite girl ever.\"\n\nHe kissed me again, this time I embraced him back.\n\nHe pushed me back a little.\n\n\"Go home now, get ready for the date. I'll be by your house by 14:00.\"\n\nHe took me to the door. This time I jumped to embrace his neck and kissed him.\n\nAfter some time he pushed me back.\n\n\"You know, we better hide it for now. So we'll have to control ourselves, ok? Never in public, not at least where people we know can see us, right?\"\n\nI nodded and said goodbye before a quick kiss as he opened the door for me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, that's it for now... I got home and started writing this before getting myself ready.\n\nAs I said, I needed to tell this to someone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR: I invited myself over to a sleepover on my cousin's home. Got him drunk, tried to seduce him. Asked him to a date. Ended learning he (and probably most of my family) already knew about my crush.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

The date... thing.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Sure.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;So, are you ok with it? Werent you just saying that to make go back to sleep?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He then put the bowl down, grabbed me by my chin and kissed me. I felt like I was melting. It was finally happening. He stopped and looked me in the eyes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I know you. I&amp;#39;ve always knew you. I know what you&amp;#39;re felling. I always suspected it. And I want it too, you&amp;#39;re my favorite girl ever.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He kissed me again, this time I embraced him back.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He pushed me back a little.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Go home now, get ready for the date. I&amp;#39;ll be by your house by 14:00.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He took me to the door. This time I jumped to embrace his neck and kissed him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After some time he pushed me back.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You know, we better hide it for now. So we&amp;#39;ll have to control ourselves, ok? Never in public, not at least where people we know can see us, right?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I nodded and said goodbye before a quick kiss as he opened the door for me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, that&amp;#39;s it for now... I got home and started writing this before getting myself ready.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As I said, I needed to tell this to someone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR: I invited myself over to a sleepover on my cousin&amp;#39;s home. Got him drunk, tried to seduce him. Asked him to a date. Ended learning he (and probably most of my family) already knew about my crush.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
