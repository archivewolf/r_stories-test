My sister's name is Jasmine, she's 23.\n\nWe've always had a tumultuous relationship ever since we were young. I was very shy and quiet, struggling to really make any friends. Being trans certainly didn't help: I enjoyed cute things, playing with dolls, etc. I got bullied a lot. I guess, in the grand scheme of things, I was pretty lucky. I may not have had many friends, but those I did have were very dear to me, and I spent most of my time studying so my grades were excellent. Plus, I got put on hormones pretty early, so I never really hit my male puberty.\n\nMy sister was pretty much the opposite, she was still smart, but she was popular and loud. She could even be a bit of a bully, sometimes directed at me: it was never anything bad, just remarks on how girly I was [prior to me coming out]. After I came out as trans, things got weirder, she wasn't such a bully, but still could be a little rough. She was very controlling and bossy, but I would never say no because I really didn't want to get her angry.\n\nThat really kept up until now. I only noticed it recently, but, the fact that it had continued for so long was actually bothering me. Bothering me enough that I confronted her on it. She laughed and said, \"Do you want me to stop, Princess?\" Which, is weird, she never really called me by a nickname. I told her I did, and well, she did.\n\nI thought all was said and done, but through the next week, things changed. She'd touch me a lot, rub her body against me, even grab my butt at one point. Then I got a message from her, telling me to see her in her bedroom at 7:30pm. Our mom was also going out that day for drinks with a friend and would be gone after 7pm. Regardless, I went and met her.\n\nWhen I came in, she gave me a smile and told me to sit on the floor. Then she said things along the lines of, 'You're really weak, you need someone to look after you, someone to take charge of you. You've always been a good girl for me, so let's make that more formal.' Then she told me to take off my clothes. I refused until she stood up, \"Well, I can punish you instead, then force you out of them.\" And, she'd be more than right, from experience I know that she can hurt. So I reluctantly did.\n\nI was there, sitting naked in front of my sister, while she just grinned. She told me to stand give her a twirl. As I turned, she slapped my ass and laughed. Then she told me to sit again. Next thing I know, she's playing with my clit [Sorry, I hate calling it a penis, etc.] using her feet. I don't really get hard at this point, but she seemed amused by that. This goes on for a bit longer before she leans in and says, \"You're going to obey me from now on.\" Then she tells me to leave.\n\nI picked up my clothes and came back to my room. Then, the next couple hours were spent with me looking through this subreddit looking for anyonw who may have had similar experiences, though I didn't find any - I definitely didn't get a little distracted by any posts.\n\nAnyways, the next morning, I only saw my sister for an hour at the most. She was getting ready for work, but she didn't make any mention of the previous evening. If anything, she seemed more relaxed than normal. It was weird, and well, now I'm just confused.\n\nI couldn't lie and say that it didn't arouse me a ton. But, well, I'll be honest, I enjoy a good incest story, but I've never really imagined anything like that would ever happen. At least, not in this way - though that is a story I don't know if I want to tell right now. Anyways, um, advice or anything really? A little help is all I really want here.",
