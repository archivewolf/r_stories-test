                        "selftext": "So last night my sister slept with me again claiming a movie she saw scared her. It wasn't an issue until she rolled half her body on top of me while slightly moving around. That honestly got me horny because whatever soap she used taking a bath was really strong and her skin was really smooth. Had a very realistic dream that night that she rode me cowgirl style. It actually felt like it happened and for all I know she did mess with me in my sleep because once I really fall asleep it's hard to wake me up. \n\nAnyways after getting up this morning and having finally pulled together will power. I choose to ask my sister if she had seen anything improper on my computer. She chuckled before explaining the fact I didn't clear my download history on my desktop. Normally I use in private mode for when downloading online porn to store on my external locked hard drive, but clearly I slipped up once and after my sister looked up my fetish she basically understood how to tease me with it. \n\nThis soon led to a long conversation about it and she was more understanding than I expected. Though my sister told me she honestly found my fetish funny and burst out laughing when she first looked it up because she didn't think anyone could enjoy such a thing upon first glance. \n\nThe atmosphere of the conversation shifted over time until changing topic's where she talked about what happened when going out with her friends yesterday. One of them that is 20 years old apparently confessed to having a crush on me and wanted my sister to ask me how I felt about it. \n\nBefore given a chance to reply my sister then said, \"Because you are inexperienced and have utterly failed a number of first dates I need to be your practice girlfriend so you don't embarrass us both in front of my friends.\"\n\nI asked what she meant by that because while we have role played together before it was never on this topic. My sister replied that first I should take her out to lunch like I would take a girl on a date and then she would tell me what I could do better the next time. \n\nGetting fairly hungry myself I agreed and tried to keep myself calm as I wanted to see where she was going with this. Overall eating lunch together still ended up feeling very causal, but there was some tension in the air when I asked how long she planned on giving me \"practice\". Her reply was something to the effect of however long it takes for me to learn how dating girls works.\n\nThings really got interesting upon coming back home after my sister told me I should display more confidence and assert myself more in conversations. While I sat on the sofa in the living room she came out wearing only underwear and snuggled next to me while holding my arm. \n\nAs I've said before her wearing underwear during the day at home is fairly common, but it's rare from what I have seen for her to be physically affectionate toward anyone. So while flushed I asked her what she wanted to do now. My sister then smiled before telling me to kiss her as I would if she was my girlfriend. \n\nTurning into an excited nervous wreak I gave her a peck on her cheek. With a disappointed look on her face she told me that's a family kiss and told me to kiss her on the lips. My mind started racing as this was starting to turn me on. After taking a few deep breathes I while embracing her planted my lips upon hers for the first time in my life.\n\nUpon the departure of our lips I got up to get a drink for both of us while still in shock of what I had just done. After getting our lips moistened my sister said that along with getting used to being touched by girls I needed to learn how making out should be done. Allowing her to take the lead she locked lips with me while sticking her tongue inside my mouth.  \n\nIt soon turned into a fairly electrifying experience for me as I finally let myself go. At this point \"practice\" or not it felt amazing and ended up picking her up to pin against the wall. Truth be told the urge to fuck her right there on the spot burned deep at this point as her soft body was pressed against me. This moment was the most horny I felt in over 6 months if not in my whole life and I know she had to feel my dick hard as nails though my pants pressing into her. \n\nAfter a while I could tell something bothered her so I stopped and she told me that while I was doing well she wanted some time to herself. Going back into my own room I felt guilt and doubt crush me as I was left wondering if this was going to forever damage our relationship. It didn't seem like she was angry, but I could tell something bothered her greatly. Making things worse I started to think about what my mother would think of us crossing the line into having sexual relations. A chill ran though my spine when I thought about what her dad would think if he ever found out as he is a tough 6'5'' ex boxer that is one of the least open minded people I know.  \n\nI mean sure I had thought about this all for at least a month now, but until this weekend it just didn't seem real. I had tried to treat the possibility of incest as something happening to some far away person I didn't know or a fictional event in a hazy dream of mine. Yet here I was in the middle of a murky situation where I had made out with my own flesh and blood sister. After playing some video games I pulled my mind at least somewhat out of the shock I was experiencing.  \n\nLater that evening before we started eating dinner I asked her if everything was okay. My sister replied, \u201cI am fine, it's just as my pretend boyfriend I want you to slow down.\u201d\n\nStill feeling guilt I apologized for making her feel uncomfortable and we moved on to mostly just eating as there wasn't much to discuss at this point. After wishing her good night I sit here locked up in my room wondering how this is going to go. Before today I always seemed to have some factor of deniability on my side as everything unfolded, but even I the virgin with limited dating experience knows this isn't really pretending or simply \u201cpractice\u201d. I can only guess she must be feeling guilt and doubt about taking the full plunge into a incestuous relationship. \n\nI know people are likely to suggest that I try confronting her in a forward manner about this. But considering we both were raised with parents that preferred disciplinary order with fixed values, moral standards and gender roles. I honestly think trying to force a straight forward answer out of my sister would be like pouring gallons of salt upon all the wounds she must be dealing with. Then there's the reality that our relationship would need to be secret and between our mother, her father and my father I think my father would be the \u201cmost\u201d able to handle knowing about us having a sexual relationship, but really even he would likely yell at me and berate me for being a \u201cmoral degenerate\u201d.\n\nIf anyone has suggestions on how I should proceed from here, that would be helpful as now I really don't know what I'm doing and while my sister seems like she wants to help I worry about messing our relationship up.
