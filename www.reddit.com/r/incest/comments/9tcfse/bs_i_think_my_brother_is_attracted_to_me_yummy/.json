                        "selftext": "Hey again! So last night was... interesting, to say the least. If you read my updates (in my comment history!) we got to the point of watching a movie and drinks after dinner. I thought I was ready for whatever came flying at me because of the way every inch of my body fluttered with his kiss on the cheek, holding me, fixing my hair, etc. I'm getting excited just thinking about it right now, ughhhh. So so hot. We sat on the couch and ended up watching The Conjuring, which I think he TOTALLY planned because he KNOWS I don't like scary movies. I tried to protest, but he gave me that reassuring look that he always gives me, I'm such a sucker for it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe curled up on the loveseat on opposite ends and I think we both knew the other was nervous, so we had our own respective blankets. Since it's a pretty small couch, his legs were more so in my space. Like I said, he's tall. He's 6'4\" and I'm a measly 5'0. Apparently, he got daddy's height and i got mom's haha. We're watching the movie and since his legs are in my space, he starts just innocently touching my butt with his feet every once in a while. I kind of attributed it to him adjusting/twitching/whatever, but he eventually ended up caressing my butt with his foot, and as weird as that sounds, I was going crazy over it. Each touch he made sent electric shocks through my body. So we get to the first scary part (I won't spoil it, promise!) and I twitch a LOT and hide under my blanket. Lol, I'm such a big baby. I looked over at him and he was just smirking at me with his goofy little smirk and then he lifted his blanket and said \"come on little bear, I'll protect you.\" How could I say no to that!? Fucking swooon. PS, he calls me \"little bear\" and i call him \"brother bear,\" I'm not really sure where these nicknames started but we were way younger.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was super nervous as I was crawling over and genuinely thought my stomach was doing somersaults in my body, but as soon as I curled up into his lap literally every single worry I had went right away. I snuggled against him (I was sitting sideways in his lap, my right side was against him) and nuzzled my head into his neck. I really couldn't have been more comfortable than I was in that moment. He was rubbing up and down my thigh gently with his fingertips and he kissed the side of my head and I fell asleep soon after, I'm assuming. I don't know how long we sat there like that, but I kind of melted into my him and lost track of time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNext thing I know, I'm waking up slowly but I actually feel him hard as a fucking rock against me.. I originally was sitting sideways on his lap, but I've always moved around a lot in my sleep and I actually ended up straddling him with my arms wrapped around him and my face still nuzzled in his neck. Since I had the dress on, it was kind of hiked up a little bit and his hard cock was pressed right up against my panties.. FUCK, it took every ounce of willpower within me to not moan or let him know I was awake at all. He was still watching something, I'm not totally sure what but I heard it in the background. I didn't move or anything because I didn't want this moment to end, my brothers hard cock pressed right up against me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEventually I couldn't handle it anymore and I pretended to actually wake up and kissed his cheek and said \"hi there brother bear.\" and smiled at him with my sleepy lil smile. He kind of froze and I saw his eyes get HUGE when he realized that I knew his cock was pressing against me. He muttered out a bunch of apologies and I assured him that it was okay and I REALLY didn't want it to stop. I kind of just stared at up at him for what I'm sure was only like 10 seconds before I looked down because I was still struggling with the whole \"what the fuck?\" aspect of this all. It was like a repeat of what happened last week with him grabbing my cheek and lifting my face and looking at me. Not really at me like you'd look at anyone, but he SAW me, like no one has ever SEEN me, if that makes sense... He whispered into my ear, \"little bear, you are the most beautiful thing I've ever laid eyes on and I've thought that for my whole entire life\" and then moved his hand to the back of my neck and KISSED me. When I say kissed me, I don't mean a pretty good kiss, I mean like he seriously reached my soul through my fucking mouth and it was the greatest kiss I have ever had and honestly think I ever will have. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe sat just like that, making out and me grinding against him for about 10 minutes. He eventually couldn't take it anymore and slid my boobs out of my dress and he started squeezing one nipple with his fingers and he took the other one in his mouth. Ever since getting my nipples pierced a few years ago, the sensation has been WAY increased. If you're out there thinking if you should get your nipples pierced, DO IT! It feels incredible having someone flick their tongue against the piercing haha. He played with my boobs for quite a while, licking and kissing and biting them until I just about came. I whispered into his ear that I was about to cum and he reached down and slid his thumb into my panties and rubbed my clit. SPLOOSH, took probably about 10 more seconds for me to cum. FUCK, it was so hot.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe ended up carrying me into bed because I was seriously lightheaded from cumming so hard. It was one of the most intense orgasms I have ever had. He slid off my dress and panties and then gently laid me down and he crawled over top of me and kissed me just as deep as the first time. He started trailing his lips and tongue to my earlobe, down my neck and across my collarbones. He revisited my nipples and gave each of them a little nibble or two. He trailed his way down my stomach, around my belly button, and he took his time and kissed up and down my thighs and spread them apart slowly. He actually started to kind of analyze my pussy, and I got really nervous and embarrassed. I closed my legs and he came back up to my face and asked me what was wrong, and I told him how I always thought I had an ugly pussy and didn't want him to look at it. He grabbed my chin, turned my head, and whispered into my ear \"you're my beautiful little bear and you have the prettiest pussy i have ever fucking seen, and I want to invade it in every way possible, may i please?\" \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet me tell you, I have never been so turned on in my entire life. I couldnt even muster out the word yes, I kind of just gasped and moaned and shoved his head back down there. I locked his head to my pussy by holding it there with my thighs. I have thick thighs, so he wasn't going anywhere. He ate me out so long and so incredibly that I actually came a few times, and I NEVER cum from a guy going down on me. I guess having your brothers tongue all over your pusssy really has that affect haha. He finger fucked me and ate me out so fucking amazingly that I had to beg him to stop after like 4 orgasms. He wore me out (and wore himself out) that we actually decided after talking a bit about it that we would just head to bed. Waiting would make everything WAY more intense, anyways. Plus he had a few reservations about us having sex, and I was also kind of on the same page. I wanted to go down on him, but he insisted that tonight was all about me. We eventually drifted off to sleep, he was spooned up behind me and I could feel his hardness against my ass. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nApparently, waiting wasn't really his style because I actually woke up to him on top of me, sliding his cock inside of me. I was laying on my stomach and he was hovering over me. I was kind of taken by surprise at first and I got a little nervous, but then he whispered \"it's just me little bear, it's okay. I will stop if you want me to.\" and it felt WAY too good to let him stop, so I pressed myself up onto my knees and kept my head down, because let's face it - face down, ass up, is the superior position haha. He took that cue to grab my hair and pull my head backwards and fuck me like he really meant it. I honestly think I came within 15 seconds. He took longer than I did. I moaned out how he could be rough as he wanted with me, so he started slapping my ass and pulling my hair and holding me down by my shoulders. He suddenly stopped and commanded that i go onto my knees on the floor, because he wanted to \"look into his baby sister's eyes as he took the last bit of innocence from me.\" FUCK. OH MY GOD i can't even handle it talking about it today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was on my knees and he positioned himself in front of me, his cock dangling right over me. He told me to not break eye contact until he said I was allowed, so being the good baby sister I am, I didn't. I let him fuck my face until he came, which took about a minute. I was never a huge fan of face fucking, but I would really let my brother fuck my face until he gets sick of it. Fuck me, it was so so hot. He came all over my face/chest and then walked me to the bathroom and cleaned me up, telling me what a good little sister I am for him and then carried me back to bed. I fell asleep instantaneously haha. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGuys, I REALLY am glad you talked me into going over. I have NEVER been so consistently horny in my life. I feel like i'm about 2 seconds from cumming at all times. Work today was SUPER hard haha. I woke up before him and I was going to wake him up to say goodbye, but he looked so peaceful so I just left for work and left a note saying \"love you brother bear.\" He texted me when he woke up and told me that he was sad he missed me, and he couldn't stop thinking about last night. We texted a little bit back and forth and I'm waiting on him to answer. I think he fell back asleep. Today's his day off. I'm not sure if I'm going back over tonight, but I really want to. I never craved anything so bad in my life.. If I end up going over, I'll update you and let you know. Thanks for reading guys!",

As I enjoy the beginning of if a person can open there eyes enough and expand their thoughts to fight the social wall. I understand people when they claim it is illegal in a US State.

I had many years fighting my own battles internally trying to figure out what I am. I prayed for a person that appear in my life as if magic.

Honestly I've always seen when these relationships develop into romance that marriage is only passing a family name down. While woman were used as ways to solve conflicts with nations or create close trades or benefits. Sold to the best suited family, some Japanese families still practice this. Also arrange marriages or marriage profiles if not settled by 30. They marry 14yr middle school girls to 20yrs old families to ensure a good well look after life. Some like it some hate it. I want to move there. \n\nI am interested in your desire to what you plan, it is not as if you are un accustom to living around each other. Also sounds like you hang out regularly anyway, can always say you are saving for schooling or for traveling so he was happy to have you move in. I envy that kiss and I want more details if you decide to get more juicy as well as the idea of if you just plan a sex friend situation. But if I had that chance I'd grab and never let go of that passion care love. Knowing each others pros and cons. I tried scaring a person I met online the first time laying in  bed telling them every single horrible thing I could remember and they did the same. I wished for a friend and got one. But do wish there was some passion. \n\nAlso everything you think you know about being in a Related Relationship or they call Incestuous behavior is wrong. They have created this way to prevent so many people being happy. People grow up and some can say they like or find their mom extremely attractive and beautiful even sexy. But despite that they don't feel that way, and that goes for people we all know in our lives.. just because a brother recognizes his sister as if they are a model they just don't feel that way. The poor people that harbor one sided love after being told no.\n\nAlso the idea of deformed babies is completely bullshit. I read a couple talking about the genetic problem that a woman can carry, or if certain genetic conditions are similar but these are things that happen to everyone. Twins are a form of a deformed cell that has a chance to split into two people. Also twins of that nature have a massive chance of being and living with each other and being romantically involved. Or they seek independent identity. Like magnets flipped. Just food for thought, I hope your story is real and but either way my comment could save a person suffering with this idea. I will never be go for it, but more just wanting people to realize that you are aloud to treat them as a human and love them as a human. Kind of like a husband or wife that can't divorce Haha. ",
