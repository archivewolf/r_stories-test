I think I get it and I thank you guys for all the advice. Following it, I greatly reduced the accidental flashing, which turns out seemingly is a form of sexual teasing, and decided to interact a little more \u201cdirectly\u201d with my little brother. To be clear, I took pleasure out of my brother seeing me in \u201caccidental\u201d (when in reality I orchestrated those) situations. I didn\u2019t stop completely, but lately I\u2019ve been trying to involve him more in situations we could both enjoy more, like cuddling.\n\nAfter my last post quite some weeks went by. It got colder quickly here, and I dressed accordingly around the house which left me way less options to show off to my brother, but that might be better anyway (see above). What kind of just happened though is that we cuddle a little more while watching movies. Danny somehow just (surprisingly I gotta admit!) started putting his head on my lap. Once, our mom came into Danny\u2019s room while we watched videos positioned like that. I was kinda nervous but she didn\u2019t really react differently to it.\n\nHe massages me less since I didn\u2019t go bare legs anymore (I usually wear sweatpants at home at the moment), and I didn\u2019t want to ask him to all the time. Last week, when our parents were out for the evening, we wound up watching one of my little brother\u2019s favourite youtubers play games (which I kind of grew to like, some games have really interesting stories). Danny put his head sideways on my lap as we\u2019re used to by now, and I usually play with his hair or just put my hand on his shoulder. I really enjoy that, and I believe he does too. It feels endearing that my brother wants to be close to me. Having his head so close to my crotch usually got me feeling tingly down there, but over time it faded a little. With our parents finally out for once though, I felt like doing something again.I usually join Danny after doing my evening routine which is showering, brushing teeth, etc. so I can lounge around clean in my cozy sleeping attire (which are long cotton pants with nothing underneath - I like it \u201cbreezy\u201d yet warm down there - and usually an old t-shirt).\n\nI came up with it on the spot, and when not so much happened in the video, I casually asked Danny: \u201cIs it comfy in my lap?\u201d and he said yes. I kind of got hot in the face with embarrassment asking \u201cDon\u2019t you mind\u2026 the smell?\u201d - \u201cWhat smell?\u201d he asked back. \u201cWell... \u201c I started. We never really talked about that stuff and I felt almost uncomfortable talking about private parts with my little brother. Also, I wasn't sure how familiar he actually was with the subject matter. \u201c...I'm relieved you didn't notice it!\u201d I avoided it. He lifted his head from my lap to face me. \u201cWhat smell? Now I'm curious\u201d Danny said. It was embarrassing to say out loud, but I said to my little brother \u201cuh\u2026 kittens have a certain smell usually. Since you're down there.\u201d (I literally said kittens in our language because I felt too weird calling my lady parts anything else to my little brother). \u201cKittens?\u201d - \u201cUh.. lady parts\u201d I said hesitantly, wishing I didn't start the weird topic on second thought. \u201cOh\u2026\u201d Danny just said, still propped up from my lap, looking at my (sweatpants-clad) crotch briefly and then away. \u201cI don\u2019t think I smell anything\u201d he said. Just a very small time passed but nobody said anything and it felt really weird so I quickly diverted the topic \u201cYou've had one girlfriend right?\u201d - \u201cYes, only one, Anne\u201d Danny replied. \u201cWhy?\u201d I gently pushed his head back onto my lap and we somehow started talking about my little brother's love life.\n\nAt first, I kind of had to keep it going with questions and I could tell he was very hesitant telling me about it, but eventually we got into a natural conversational flow about his experiences. The first talk we really had in this detail! On the topic of a pussy\u2019s smell, turns out Danny is actually a virgin. \u201cSo, like, how far have you guys gone if I may ask?\u201d I wound up asking. After some convincing Danny admitted his sexual experiences entail only second base hand stuff and receiving oral once, so he actually doesn't really have experienced lady parts per se. Hearing about my little brother having had those experience was fun but also very very weird somehow, I can\u2019t describe it better. Throughout the whole conversation I ran my fingers through his hair and he snuggled up on my lap. Talking about all the sex stuff made me excited and I felt warmed up. \u201cUltimately, lady parts have a certain smell to them usually\u201d I made the full circle and explained some more basic things. Danny told me that he never noticed odd smells and that I usually smell nice. \u201cWait, I\u2019ll show you so you know in future. Try facing downwards\u201d I suggested to him and my little brother did as I said, so he was kind of face-down on my lap. \u201cIt\u2019s probably really mild if anything because I shower before we watch videos together\u201d. As I said that, I opened my legs a little (still wearing my sweatpants of course). It felt incredibly naughty, my brother\u2019s head was now kind of leaning against my lower belly, his face prodded on my right thigh and looking right towards my crotch. He inhaled audibly and I felt like I was about to die from embarrassment, but I felt horny too. I just endured it and kept my legs slightly spread with my little brother\u2019s face kind of right between them. \u201cYes, I think I smell your\u2026 hm hm now Sis\u201d he said quietly. I chuckled because he said \u201chm hm\u201d instead of something else. \u201cBut your pants have a nice laundry scent so it kind of mixes up\u201d. I nervously laughed a little and said \u201cnow you know what *hm hm*s smell like. It\u2019s unpleasant, right?\u201d. Danny surprisingly inhaled again and said \u201cno, you just smell nice overall. It\u2019s a little unusual but not in a bad way\u201d. Being aware that Danny can now smell my pussy was enticing and weird at the same time. I thought he\u2019d rather be grossed out by the smell. At the same time, it made me horny. \u201cThen you can always lie on my lap\u201d I tried to reply in a playful manner. \u201cYay\u201d he said and wrapped his arms around my waist whilst still on my lap with his head and hugged me tight. My heart warmed up with affection at the moment and I ran my hand through his hair. I just naturally kept my legs spread a little and we just stayed in the position but Danny put his head back on my right thigh more so he could turn and watch the video. I tried to look at his pants some times but he laid in a way I couldn\u2019t see anything. After the video ended we just kind of sat and lied there still for a little moment. \u201cI really enjoy spending time together\u201d I eventually told my dear little bro heartfelt. \u201cMe too. I like lying in your lap too\u201d Danny said to which I replied \u201cI like having you there\u201d. Eventually I could hear our parents coming home downstairs to which I overreacted a little bit. We decided to go down and say hello, and for the rest of the evening nothing really happened anymore. Well, I was still feeling horny so I went to town on myself after going to bed but that's not what this is about haha ;)\n\nSorry I have nothing sexier to tell about for now, I know you guys are in it for the sexy stuff but this is about it for until last week and I\u2019m trying to tune down the \u201caccidental\u201d teasing following you guys' advice. But I feel like I made quite some progress with my brother regardless, in different aspects. Also it\u2019s currently difficult finding time to write these up, I kind of keep a little diary thing but it\u2019s not in English and whatnot, I\u2019ll try to post more regularly but something always comes up :( Oh and I wanted to thank you guys again for all the advice, especially sending me articles and stuff about how teasing might impact my brother. I might not completely stop it but I'll try to do it in ways he can enjoy it more as well.",

I was kind of late on the last post, so I don't think you've seen my message, and if you have, sorry for the spam, but I'll repost a couple points/ideas, except with adjustments to fit this post :D\n\n1. I commented on someone's comment on your last post about what you can do for the next massage. Next time, wear a bra, one that can open from the back, and of course something over, preferably a tank top or crop top. Then either wait for him to ask you if you want a massage, or you can ask him to give you one. Once he starts, you can say something along the lines of: \"Argh, I feel the top catching on my bra. I wasn't wearing one the last time you massaged me. Is it alright with you if I take it off?\". Of course, he'll bable out a yes. Now you're only in bra and panties, more intimate than before. From here, it's also possible to open the bra...\n2. He definently has something for legs/feet. He wanted to massage those last time, and the same in your last post. Perhaps you could use this in some way. Stockings, long socks, whatever.\n3. You should take a picture or look in the mirror to see how wet you are, and how visible it is - which i think it is.\n4. As he asked that question about the thong last time, he must've been looking a lot at your ass and panties (naturally and expected of course). And yeah, i'm pretty sure you would be visibly wet.\n5. Him laying his head in your lap could be several different things, probably a mix. For one, it ads to him liking legs (and feet). You should also take in mind that he's maybe trying to smell you. That's what I would be doing like that, honestly. I would recommend you to at some point lay your head on him the same way. This shows equal liking and intimacy. I'm sure that would have some kind of reaction as well. Maybe it's possible for you to move your head back as well, hitting him \"there\"... (Keep developing with the smelling thin. One idea could be to masturbate beforehand instead of showering, so that he definently can smell you. As you've now talked about it, maybe he will make a comment on it smelling more).\n6. About it being innocent to him. I highly doubt that. I'm sure he feels the same things you do. The excitment. At least it's not 100% innocent, and he must know it.\n7. Last thing. Even though he says he doesn't want a massage, you should give him one as well. His sister's soft hands on his body will do things to him (and in another way, you as well) that I'm sure he'll like. You can also tease him this way by pressing up against him in different ways.",

I think it\u2019s wrong of you to do something that could be seen as sexual harassment if you were both 18+, in the workplace, &amp; OP was a male. \n\nBeing aroused/liking something is one thing but given that you have stated your intentions, that you are using your body to manipulate someone to achieve sexual gratification... when the **victim** is presumably a minor &amp; unaware of those intentions... But confirmed a **virgin**. \n\nYour actions are going to drastically impact his psyche. Drastically. Think USA Gymnastics. He hasn\u2019t had sex yet and by **forcing** this fetish upon him without talking with him beforehand is irresponsible. How will this impact his future? His relationships? His kids? Will he be *\u201dnaughty\u201d* with **them** too? My point here: if you don\u2019t know he is ok with this then you may instill onto him the logic that \u201cthe ends justify the means\u201d or \u201cI ended up really enjoying myself with my sister, so it\u2019s ok\u201d but what happens 15 years from now when he has kids? With this, the ends do not justify the means. He is a minor by law, he does not know your **numerous** attempts at seduction, and (my main issue) he is a virgin. \n\nConclusion: there are a multitude of ways this can play out, you maybe acting irrational or negligent as someone whom presumably cares for your brothers psychological well-being, and potentially this sub has become an echo chamber promoting your *\u201dnaughty\u201d* behavior to serve there fetish because the collectives *\u201dhm hm\u201d* gets *\u201dtingly\u201d*.\n\nLet me be clear. There are things I can not know because I do not know you. There are things I do not know because I stopped reading. The actions I have read about and the stated intentions backing them are wrong for a sister to do. And if OP were a brother, people would care more. Stop *molesting* and start *confessing*.

I think it\u2019s wrong of you to do something that could be seen as sexual harassment if you were both 18+, in the workplace, &amp;amp; OP was a male. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Being aroused/liking something is one thing but given that you have stated your intentions, that you are using your body to manipulate someone to achieve sexual gratification... when the &lt;strong&gt;victim&lt;/strong&gt; is presumably a minor &amp;amp; unaware of those intentions... But confirmed a &lt;strong&gt;virgin&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your actions are going to drastically impact his psyche. Drastically. Think USA Gymnastics. He hasn\u2019t had sex yet and by &lt;strong&gt;forcing&lt;/strong&gt; this fetish upon him without talking with him beforehand is irresponsible. How will this impact his future? His relationships? His kids? Will he be &lt;em&gt;\u201dnaughty\u201d&lt;/em&gt; with &lt;strong&gt;them&lt;/strong&gt; too? My point here: if you don\u2019t know he is ok with this then you may instill onto him the logic that \u201cthe ends justify the means\u201d or \u201cI ended up really enjoying myself with my sister, so it\u2019s ok\u201d but what happens 15 years from now when he has kids? With this, the ends do not justify the means. He is a minor by law, he does not know your &lt;strong&gt;numerous&lt;/strong&gt; attempts at seduction, and (my main issue) he is a virgin. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: there are a multitude of ways this can play out, you maybe acting irrational or negligent as someone whom presumably cares for your brothers psychological well-being, and potentially this sub has become an echo chamber promoting your &lt;em&gt;\u201dnaughty\u201d&lt;/em&gt; behavior to serve there fetish because the collectives &lt;em&gt;\u201dhm hm\u201d&lt;/em&gt; gets &lt;em&gt;\u201dtingly\u201d&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let me be clear. There are things I can not know because I do not know you. There are things I do not know because I stopped reading. The actions I have read about and the stated intentions backing them are wrong for a sister to do. And if OP were a brother, people would care more. Stop &lt;em&gt;molesting&lt;/em&gt; and start &lt;em&gt;confessing&lt;/em&gt;. Speak with him.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
