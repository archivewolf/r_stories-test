I knew I needed it so I did what any normal person would do. I went back home. \nYeah, big mistake. \n\n\nWhat I actually did was wait outside of my mother's house for a while until she left, and she did. I used the key I still had and unlocked the door. I walked in and up to my old bedroom. When I entered I found my TV I paid for smashed, my Playstation smashed, my poster of Spider-Man was cut to shreds with the knife marks going as deep as the wall. My room looked like someone threw a hissyfit. \n\n\nI had my birth certificate locked in as safe under my bed. It was one of those, \"fire proofed\" safes. I picked it up like a brief case and carried it to the counter. \n\n\nI grabbed a few shirts and walked out the door. \nMy mom was pulling back into the drive way as I was getting into my car. She looked at me, at my shirts, said something about private property and being and entering. She had her cell phone out pounding numbers in and walking over to my car. I immediately took off. Fuck her. \n\n\nI got back to the apartment, they were nice people, they understood our problem. Not the incest bit, but the parents not understanding our love. My cousin, Brittany, met me at the door as I walked in. She kissed me, on the lips like normal people do. \n\n\nShe asked me how I was doing. I just shrugged. My life, my dreams were put on hold because we were in love. I told her what mom did to my room and she was as angry as I was.\n\n\nGood news, we are still as sexual as ever and we had sex that night, lucky problem is that it was pur first mistake while having sex. We weren't prepared and it happened. We had no protection and yes she's now pregnant. I'm scared about that. We barely have money to survive ourselves, let alone a child who might have genetic problems that would cost money to fix. [Tips?]\n\n\nAnyways a few days after that I was approached by a couple of cops at my job. They asked about me being on my mom's property. I said I was but I was picking up my own stuff.\n\n\nHe told me that I was still trespassing. I was arrested and was put in jail for the weekend. Which was too long for me, but after seeing the judge he dropped the charges after finding out the lady was my mother the judge, a female, apparently felt bad for me. [The fact that we were in an incestuous relationship didn't come up] \n\n\nMy job wanted to fire me for the problem, and they did, but I got a job with Brittany at a grocery store next to our apartment. \n\n\nTL;DR: Cousin is pregnant, got an apartment, mother pressed charges against me for breaking and entering but were dropped after the judge found out of my circumstances. \n",
