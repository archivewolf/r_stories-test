I had planned on writing much earlier, but life gets in the way as usual, and I didn't get to it until now. First, some background. A lot of this is fairly boring, and if any of you want to skip to the good stuff, wait until my second post. For the rest of you who want the whole story, here goes.\n\nI always had a thing for incest, but up until this past year had only discussed it with one other close friend as it's obviously generally frowned upon in society, and my family is pretty religious, so even normal sex was considered extremely taboo. I have a younger brother and sister. My brother had been the black sheep of the family since he came out of the closet as gay a few years back, and my sister and I seemed to be the only ones in the family who actually had his back and just accepted him as he was. To be fair, my parents didn't cast him out or anything so extreme, but still considered him being gay to be sinful, and anytime the topic came up, things got extremely awkward. Needless to say, I didn't want to be the next black sheep so to speak, so I kept my incestuous fantasies secret from everyone.\n\nSince I brought it up, I've always been straight, and the only incest I found interesting was brother/sister or sister/sister type stuff. Even so, I still had never looked at my sister that way before, and had a fairly normal sex life all kept hidden from my family, other than my brother since he was nosy and liked to know what was going on.\n\nTo set up the circumstances that started this whole mess, I'll move on. Certain details are going to be glossed over for obvious reasons, and I figured our names are common enough that it'd be difficult to figure out our real identities. I'm Derek, currently 24, my younger brother is Dylan, aged 21 (a while ago I used his name as a pseudoname since it was easy to just go with another D name), and my baby sister is Ally, age 19. Though our family was religious, none of us were ever very emotionally connected, and had drifted apart in recent years, mainly because there was always a sibling rivalry between Dylan and me, and Ally and I had never been all that close before due to the age gap. In addition to all that, Dylan and I had moved out for university as soon as we graduated, leaving Ally back home, all living our separate lives.\n\nFor years I switched between majors and schools, trying to figure out what I was going to do with my life. At around 21, I met a girl who I started dating whose name isn't important. She was from out of state, and things got pretty serious between us. The next year, she finished up her undergrad and was going for her masters at a different university that was out of state, but we decided to work through the distance since things had been going so well. The plan was for me to move up with her as soon as I could, but it was about a year before I got everything to go through, and by the time I was waiting for my acceptance letter about a year later, things fell apart and we broke up. I was devastated, because we'd been together for 2 years and I had been so naive and given up nearly everything to make things work for her. I gave up my apartment and was living with my parents again to save money for the move, and living with my parents was quite a chore with all of the religious pressure. I was at a low point, and this is where everything with Ally started.\n\nThis puts us at about April earlier this year. I worked in retail, so work was shitty, and parents were pressuring me religiously and giving me lectures when I was home from work, so home life is shitty, so my outlet was videogames. Specifically Overwatch. Funny enough, this was the one thing all of us siblings had in common. Dylan wasn't always on since he was focused on his classes, but Ally was playing as much, if not more often than me. Ally had a lot of time to herself since she didn't go straight to university after high school, and also worked in retail. We spent hours just about every day playing Overwatch together. This is where I started realizing she and I had a lot more in common than I previously thought. The age gap wasn't as big of a deal, and I started seeing her as more than just my baby sister. She was an awesome person. Ally and I had very similar personalities. We both were very logical people, and put emotions in the backseat. The sexual side of things started as a joke. We'd go into games and people assumed we were dating simply because of our chemistry. At first we both put that to bed very quickly, but soon we thought it'd be funny to mess with people. We told people that I was her 'sugar daddy' and helped boost her, a lowly Mercy main, in competitive games. Or I'd tell assholes to back off when they tried to hit on her, pretending to be her boyfriend. All just in game of course. We were quiet people and didn't like to go out and socialize in the real world.\n\nEventually, we started talking more about life and started hanging out more and more. We grew extremely close and did everything together. Talks got more serious, and I learned that she was actually a virgin. This was surprising to me, because she had boyfriends in the past, and certainly made a ton of sexual jokes (of course, only when our parents weren't around). She asked me not to tell anyone, because to her it was embarrassing, and of course I agreed, and things went as normal. More sexual jokes passed between us, and we were more open around each other, but something changed. I started seeing her in a different light. More than just my sister, or as just another person. She was gorgeous.\n\nLet's get into body descriptions. I'm 5'9 (not remarkably tall), short dark hair, brown (almost black) eyes, and have an athletic build at around 150 pounds. Ally is roughly the same height at around 5'8, long black hair that she dyed blue, and brown eyes. She has a cute, thin face, and a laugh that makes her eyes sparkle. But her body. Oh my God. Even fully clothed, she was obviously very skinny, around 120 pounds at the most. She had B-cup breasts, and amazing curves. Thin waist, but only what you could call 'baby-making hips', and an ass like nothing I've ever seen. Though I started seeing her in this new light, things between us remained more or less normal, albeit a bit flirtier.\n\nOne morning, however, things were different. Ally only made smalltalk with me, and when I ask what was up, she just sort of clammed up and mumbled something like \"of course you don't remember\" and to not worry about it. Okay, so I'd like to say I had no idea what happened, but I knew it had something to do with my little problem. At the time, I had insomnia, and was on sleeping medication, specifically Ambien. Those of you who have taken it know that it does great for putting you to sleep, but if you stay awake, it gives you a nice high. It makes you incredibly confused and very forward and open with your thoughts. But the next day, you'll have little memory of what happened. I was very dependent on these, and often played Overwatch with Ally while on them, because it's more fun to play while high. She saw it as an issue, but tended to let me be, since she also enjoyed being high or drunk depending on the day. Obviously, this time I said something. She got on Overwatch later that day, and kept declining my group invite. I got annoyed and eventually just went up to her room to ask her what was up.\n\n\"Can we talk?\" I asked.\n\nAlly had her back to me, concentrating on the game in front of her. I could tell she heard me even through the headphones, because her in game character died, and I didn't see the usual outburst of \"What the fuck?!\"\n\nI cleared my throat and tapped her shoulder.\n\n\"Fine, after this game,\" she replied.\n\nIt was a competitive match, so I could tell it would be a little while, and I wasn't about to ask her to screw over her teammates for me. I went back downstairs and waited for what seemed like an eternity, laying back on my bed staring at the ceiling. Eventually I heard my door open, and turned over to see her coming in.\n\n\"Do you remember anything from last night?\" Ally stared at me, her eyes practically accusing me of killing a puppy.\n\n\"Uh, we played Overwatch? I think?\" I couldn't make eye contact, feeling like a child.\n\nShe sighed, and sat next to me on my bed. She paused a minute, and finally said \"Look, don't take this the wrong way, but you've gotta stop drugging yourself. It's bad for you, and sometimes you tell me things and I have no idea how to repond.\"\n\n\"Ugh, what did I do this time?\" I knew what happened at this point. It was slowly coming back.\n\n\"Derek, we've been flirting around this for quite a while, but you keep going over the line when you're high. I've kinda ignored it up until now, but last night you said if I wasn't your sister you'd marry me. And not in the same joking way we talk about other shit. Other nights you just talk about how you're attracted to me, or sexual stuff that I can just pretend never happened cause you don't remember it, and in a weird way I don't mind cause I'm sure it's just the drugs talking and kinda makes me feel good about myself. But you know none of this shit can happen, right? I didn't want to talk about it, or admit anything, but it's just not realistic.\"\n\nI sat there for a good minute just processing everything. And my brain was just having an oh shit moment. I didn't realize that this wasn't the first instance.\n\n\"Well\" I started, \"Obviously it's not realistic, and I'm sorry. Ugh, look, you know I have no filter when I'm high-\"\n\n\"But did you mean it?\" Ally interrupted.\n\n\"Did I mean what?\"\n\n\"Ugh,\" she sighed. \"Do you find me attractive?\"\n\n\"I mean, objectively, yes, but that doesn't mean-\"\n\n\"Derek, it's not just you. Okay? Maybe the feeling is mutual.\"\n\nI was nervous, but really excited at where this could be going. \"Okay, but you just said let's be realistic. It's not like anything could come of this.\"\n\n\"Yea, yea, I know, but what if there was a way we could just...\" she trailed off.\n\nI was shocked, and slightly confused, but definitely could tell where this was going.\n\n\"How?\"\n\nAlly then started telling me about how this needed to be just about sex, and how nothing could happen here because she didn't want her first time to be under the same roof we'd lived our whole lives. And obviously, no one could know. I agreed, and we started talking about a roadtrip. She'd always wanted to go to California, and it'd be nice to go somewhere where no one knew who we were, and we could kind of test drive this whole thing (no pun intended). Our parents were obviously worried about us going somewhere across the country, but thought it was nice Ally and I were going on a trip together. We took the family van, put blankets in the back and got all packed up in July.\n\nThe only thought in my head as we started driving off was \"shit, this is actually happening.\"\n\nTo be continued...",

Ugh, look, you know I have no filter when I&amp;#39;m high-&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;But did you mean it?&amp;quot; Ally interrupted.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Did I mean what?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Ugh,&amp;quot; she sighed. &amp;quot;Do you find me attractive?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I mean, objectively, yes, but that doesn&amp;#39;t mean-&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Derek, it&amp;#39;s not just you. Okay? Maybe the feeling is mutual.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was nervous, but really excited at where this could be going. &amp;quot;Okay, but you just said let&amp;#39;s be realistic. It&amp;#39;s not like anything could come of this.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Yea, yea, I know, but what if there was a way we could just...&amp;quot; she trailed off.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was shocked, and slightly confused, but definitely could tell where this was going.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;How?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ally then started telling me about how this needed to be just about sex, and how nothing could happen here because she didn&amp;#39;t want her first time to be under the same roof we&amp;#39;d lived our whole lives. And obviously, no one could know. I agreed, and we started talking about a roadtrip. She&amp;#39;d always wanted to go to California, and it&amp;#39;d be nice to go somewhere where no one knew who we were, and we could kind of test drive this whole thing (no pun intended). Our parents were obviously worried about us going somewhere across the country, but thought it was nice Ally and I were going on a trip together. We took the family van, put blankets in the back and got all packed up in July.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The only thought in my head as we started driving off was &amp;quot;shit, this is actually happening.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To be continued...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
