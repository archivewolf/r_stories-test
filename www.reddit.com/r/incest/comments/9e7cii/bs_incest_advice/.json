When we have sex I fantasize she is my sister sometimes and I watch incest porn when she is not around, a lot of it.\n\nI came to reddit a while ago to feed my incest compulsion, thinking that it would give me a healthy outlet but I feel like it has only upped the anty.\n\nSo here comes the confession. My girlfriend and me went to visit my sister out of state recently and one day while they were out shopping and doing girl day stuff. I got super horny and started watching incest porn on my ipad. So i started snooping on her computer because I know she keeps it unlocked and I am not going to lie she has always been a bit of a party girl so who knows what I am going to find. She is divorced with kids and I knows trolls the internet dates fairly regularly. nothing on her computer but I did find soem discs and a vibrator in her bedside drawer. so of course I eventually find some of her nudes and a few sex pics.\n\nOf course I got overly sexually stimulated which we all knows where that leads --masterbating to those pics. And then feeling shame later.\n\nI love sex and have since early age, but i think this is getting to be too much. Confused",

Reply that you had a few fantasies when you were extra horny, but you knew your sister would never go for anything like that; she probably thought it would have been to weird. End of discussion?
