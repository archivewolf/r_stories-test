At first I was really rejecting of it but now it's becoming one of my biggest turn-ons. The part that I can't figure out, however, is whether or not she's playing with me too. She does a lot of little things, and I pick up on them, but I don't know if that's just her naturally or if she's giving me things to pick up.\n\nAnyways, the first thing I can think of is this one time my brother and I were in her room with her, and she was getting ready to go out somewhere. She was fully clothed, and has always had a tendency to ask us whether she looks good in her outfit or if she should change, but this time in specific, she asked us if her boobs looked good or she should change her bra. Naturally, we were both kind of like \"WTF\" and he even asked me if that was weird, to which we concluded it was.  \n\n\nThere's been a lot of little things in between the bigger events, like how she always runs her finger around her neckline (not necessarily through cleavage or anything, just whenever she wears a low neckline) when she would talk to me, how she would only call me into the living room to talk to her after I get off work if she was already in her relaxed clothes herself (typically sweats and a very nippy shirt), sometimes going as far to come to me if I blew past too fast, keeping her eyes low and looking down at what I felt at times was my crotch. Sometimes her words get kind of flirty, at least from what I have been picking up. Nothing too major but little things.  \n\n\nSo, I started getting bold. Going to bed naked, jacking off with the intention of being caught, letting my eyes sit somewhere for maybe a second too long - all very invasive and pervasive and made me feel gross so I stopped. Funnily enough, in the couple weeks before I moved out of her house, she actually caught me on total accident and for sure saw everything. But the weird thing is I could usually hear perfectly fine when someone opens their door or comes towards my room, but this time, nothing - before I could even react, the door swung open, and it was my mom. She had immediately started to close the door back while telling me to \"keep it down\" and that was that, never spoke of it again. The next couple days, she was being extra nice to me though.\n\nNow whenever I see her, our hugs feel longer every time. She commented on our last one even, asking me if everything was okay. She's even brought up sex - something she'd really never done before - telling me she hopes I'm being safe.",
