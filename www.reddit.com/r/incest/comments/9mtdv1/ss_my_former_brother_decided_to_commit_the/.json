Not too difficult of a transition for me, it was already getting difficult to think of her as a brother when she all but stopped wearing her \"male clothes\" and fully embraced her \"girlish\" personality and mannerisms. We've talked about what to do from here, but there's no definite plan really. She wants to keep her penis where it is, and we don't think hormones would do much good unless she wants to enhance her chest, which doesn't appeal to her much. \n\nNext up, I talked to both her and my boyfriend about the ejaculation incident... Basically my boyfriend just thought it was funny and didn't have any real problem with it, I'm glad he's supportive but he's not very helpful sometimes, lol... And I think the incident itself wasn't a big deal in the end. In the end it was all my fault anyway, and we had a laugh about how you should probably avoid ejaculating on your cat or dog, lol. Our pet boundaries (or lack thereof) are pretty well-defined now as well. I'm comfortable letting her do anything she feels like in front of me, and she can pet or scratch anywhere besides, y'know... People don't usually grab their cat or dog by the crotch, lol... And yeah, there have been some chest and butt touching, embarrassing to admit as a human but it feels kinda nice in the moment, I don't know.\n\nAlthough speaking of that, we're getting to the part where I'm kinda the problem... My sister's being very open with me lately, even more than usual, apparently deciding to commit to being a girl helped. There's the nudity and changing together which was already ongoing, and now we're openly discussing things like sex, masturbation and female anatomy. She's told me all about her (lack of a) sex life and masturbation habits and methods, I've talked a little about it myself and even gave a brief demonstration... She's touched my chest and butt (while not in pet mode), I've touched hers back and we talked about them in comparison... Last night we were talking about vaginas, since she apparently feels the need to fully understand them if she's going to be a woman, and I let her inspect and touch mine... All of this has been very matter of fact and clinical and I haven't sensed any sexual intent from her. \n\nAnd I bring that up because, no beating around the bush, it makes me horny. Which leads to more sex with my boyfriend, which my sister can definitely hear, and that only makes me more horny, lol..... It's affecting pet mode as well, it's still relaxing and mostly harmless but there's that little twinge of something extra, just a little friskiness that I'm positive is because I'm being turned on by my sister....\n\nAnd I just feel awful about it. My sister trusts me to take care of her during this troublesome part of her life, and I'm just being a huge pervert about everything. I just don't know what to do. I probably shouldn't do anything and just wait for this to pass, no idea how long that will take that.\n\nAnyway, thanks for listening to me rant I guess... Would appreciate any help or advice...",

Which I only consider to be them saying they are a man that is against gay marriage but is happy to spend hundreds of thousands on bone shaving and lifts. \n\nNote. I based crossdressing off what I have read through looking into Japanese culture, also knowing some men dress as woman and work like prostitutes, some as a form of stress relief. \n\nTransgender or renamed from transexual have always been known to take HRT as I have read.  I learnt a heap about the differences between all the differences after turning transgender myself so I only offered a simple understanding of the differences. Hormone replacemt therapy, if you undergone the crap they make you go through to double check it isn't another reason causing you the cause. Also you are warned to not take surgeries 3-4 years unto after as it can cause issues.\n\nI am sorry shemale or sissy are what I've researched and defined by what I mentioned. \n\nTransvestites, research showed they are men that refuse medical treatment and go for natural alternatives as in estrogen boosters, I know the soybean is a big part in that. But mainly they want to live a life as a woman. I was just letting her and some others that think one is the other and get them all mixed up.\n\nBut not wanting medical HRT and the desire to keep the penis functioning as nearly every Transgender looses the ability to produce seman also as time goes one. Depending on the person it will decrease in size sometimes a little to a heap. Also becoming insanely harder to please with low sex drive in some cases.\n\nI've only wanted to warn her and give her a way she can help them become ready for the life choice, it is good as it basically becomes something you may turn back from. But also at the age they are changing their mind to proceed in taking HRT at a later base once they emasculate a little more, it causes some heavy depressive symptoms. All in all if they are content I recommend not to eat red meat hear it puts hairs on your chest Haha. But it isn't hard to get estrogen online this will help him keep a shiny hair and skin. It is about as much I'm aware it doing without shutting down Male hormone production.\n\nAlso I apologize if it did come across scattered or such. But I am just sharing my opinion to help a with ideas and things to look into as well as what might someone expect. Also I never really found a straight answer on the whole Layboy phrase as it is basically a reference it seems to all of them. \n\nAlso for the fun facts every trans woman you see in a porno will have clear type orgasms to orgasms you hardly see. But I am unsure as it depends on the person and it is not recommended but a trans woman after most the body has re positioned fat and physical makeup over a rough 3 or more years can stop the hormone blocker which over time I didn't have a change in a month as I had to stop for personal reasons and it causes you mass depression as the male hormones flood the bl\u00f2od system again. But long enough maybe 4 or more the Male part will start to produce sterille seman, normally has a different color and consistency too it. It's kind of fun to have an idea of a trans woman.\n\nBut it isn't hard to find the history and such of where the names came from. There used to be a community of transvestites in India that were respected by the community and called mothers if I remember. But when invaded they were driven away and killed having most the new generation that doesn't  like the existence. ",

It&amp;#39;s kind of fun to have an idea of a trans woman.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it isn&amp;#39;t hard to find the history and such of where the names came from. There used to be a community of transvestites in India that were respected by the community and called mothers if I remember. But when invaded they were driven away and killed having most the new generation that doesn&amp;#39;t  like the existence. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

Your body grows boobs and if you are thin without much body fat they don't growl big and mostly can cover up, the effects of hormone treatment programs the body down to your mental and sexual activity to alter towards a natural born woman, your spine curves as your pelvic bone rotates. \n\nBut decision of just becoming a Transvestite as know as a Male living a life as best to look female without wanting to become female, mostly gay men but not always a case, but definitely bisexual. They are normally not wanting to become a woman or are people that don't believe in the HRT process and drugs. But stopping the flow of one hormone and having the other take over does breath taking things after five years, but if a person is to prevent puberty then use the HRT you will never have any idea they weren't of the gender of birth. DNA may never change but everything else can even your apple goes down a decent lot, can't see mine even with the neck shrinkage  voice was never deep but it has pitched up also. . \n\nBut natural estrogen boosting foods like soybeans. When a Transgender woman ask for advice I tell them drink soymilk like crazy grows your boobs like really well, helps with any woman as well and smoother skin lessen bloating as milk sludge builds in your intestine anyway this is helpful for a Transvestite. \n\nTransvestite is a rough term but the only other term I am aware of is Sissy, but envoles heaps of maintenance. Plucking any facial hair as it comes helps not needing to shave further as pubity progresses, then heavy use of moisturizing lotions as the testosterone as well as the growing pubity over time will continue bone and muscle growth heavy through 16 to 25 and continue, even if you begin puberty HRT will have the strongest effect before 25, as your bone growth stops 18 is good enough to get a bit of hip growth, helps if your broad shoulders. I took awhile to make sure it wasn't just some libido thing. \n\nTransgender/Transsexual same sex drive changes and some cases sex preference alters I just found I can be with a guy but they stress me as I still haven't completed the transition, Transvestites are different from crossdressers, as they live a lifestyle out of it. Drag queens are mostly gay men or cross dressers doing over top make up for performing. The term Shemale as everyone thinks are Transgender women on HRT they aren't.  The term came from the porn industry, they are gay men that just use lots and lots of money to get the body surgically close to a womans without any aid in hormonal therapy treatments, at best they may take an estrogen pill its little blue to increase the balance in them. Catlin Jenner did this, it's like being a Transvestite but taking it to the extreme as they intend to sexually want to mentally and physically function as a Male, most the time female clothes will cause sexual arousal. This fact alone the Catin Jenner doesn't know what the fuck they are caused millions more to lead to hate and despise Transgender Women in most cases we blend in very well, also reverting back for Shemale invokes more surgery, Transvestites just stop a female lifestyle and they may if plucked the face hair will just never have any. \n\nJust wish that people really did understand the difference between it all. It is what causes that suicide problem, they also don't take in that some people just have depression regardless. But I hope your sibling is just ok with a Transvestite lifestyle, as when younger and they start to notice more masculine traits it can cause a depressed problem, I'm pissed I didn't hit my own HRT personally wasn't to caring about having breast myself and the idea of sitting to pee kind of sucked but the lifestyle was a massive part most don't realize how much work it can be if you want to look good knowing products, what ingredients to look for applications of it all can really throw people off. I've always spent hundreds on stylists every month or so. I never found wear woman clothes excited me in the slightest. \n\nAll I figured was the idea to fully accept looking female, being unsure of what if it was what I should do drowned myself in ways to forget about it. But it always creeps back 23 I did the program the change in your body is mind blowing I had C cups in just months. Unlike my partner they are 4 years older and started a little older with different body type, and lifestyle. They just lived as normal on the HRT for 2 years before attempting  outside dressed female. I couldn't after three months wanting to or not. Also the mandatory psychiatrist said before on hormones I had to live as a woman, spent like three months at work and out the house dressed female living as a Transvestite lifestyle, not fun I heard later she shouldn't have done it. But it was like just being thrown in the deep. \n\nIf you ask what a Ladyboy is they can be a mixture between Shemale and Transgenders, my Crossdressers as they are know to do it for sexual pleasure, but Crossdressers do it as a release mentally and at night once older not really going the efforts to a Transvestite lifestyle. If this spends a bit better as even Transgenders i meet dont even realize that there is a massive difference between it all.",

I took awhile to make sure it wasn&amp;#39;t just some libido thing. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Transgender/Transsexual same sex drive changes and some cases sex preference alters I just found I can be with a guy but they stress me as I still haven&amp;#39;t completed the transition, Transvestites are different from crossdressers, as they live a lifestyle out of it. Drag queens are mostly gay men or cross dressers doing over top make up for performing. The term Shemale as everyone thinks are Transgender women on HRT they aren&amp;#39;t.  The term came from the porn industry, they are gay men that just use lots and lots of money to get the body surgically close to a womans without any aid in hormonal therapy treatments, at best they may take an estrogen pill its little blue to increase the balance in them. Catlin Jenner did this, it&amp;#39;s like being a Transvestite but taking it to the extreme as they intend to sexually want to mentally and physically function as a Male, most the time female clothes will cause sexual arousal. This fact alone the Catin Jenner doesn&amp;#39;t know what the fuck they are caused millions more to lead to hate and despise Transgender Women in most cases we blend in very well, also reverting back for Shemale invokes more surgery, Transvestites just stop a female lifestyle and they may if plucked the face hair will just never have any. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just wish that people really did understand the difference between it all. It is what causes that suicide problem, they also don&amp;#39;t take in that some people just have depression regardless. But I hope your sibling is just ok with a Transvestite lifestyle, as when younger and they start to notice more masculine traits it can cause a depressed problem, I&amp;#39;m pissed I didn&amp;#39;t hit my own HRT personally wasn&amp;#39;t to caring about having breast myself and the idea of sitting to pee kind of sucked but the lifestyle was a massive part most don&amp;#39;t realize how much work it can be if you want to look good knowing products, what ingredients to look for applications of it all can really throw people off. I&amp;#39;ve always spent hundreds on stylists every month or so. I never found wear woman clothes excited me in the slightest. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All I figured was the idea to fully accept looking female, being unsure of what if it was what I should do drowned myself in ways to forget about it. But it always creeps back 23 I did the program the change in your body is mind blowing I had C cups in just months. Unlike my partner they are 4 years older and started a little older with different body type, and lifestyle. They just lived as normal on the HRT for 2 years before attempting  outside dressed female. I couldn&amp;#39;t after three months wanting to or not. Also the mandatory psychiatrist said before on hormones I had to live as a woman, spent like three months at work and out the house dressed female living as a Transvestite lifestyle, not fun I heard later she shouldn&amp;#39;t have done it. But it was like just being thrown in the deep. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you ask what a Ladyboy is they can be a mixture between Shemale and Transgenders, my Crossdressers as they are know to do it for sexual pleasure, but Crossdressers do it as a release mentally and at night once older not really going the efforts to a Transvestite lifestyle. If this spends a bit better as even Transgenders i meet dont even realize that there is a massive difference between it all.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
