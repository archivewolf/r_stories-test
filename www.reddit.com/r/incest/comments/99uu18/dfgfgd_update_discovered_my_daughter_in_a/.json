And here's a link to the first post with other details: \n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/incest/comments/98ezeq/fd_my_daughter_seems_to_keep_stepping_up_on/\n\nRight now I am sitting in shock as I knew my father has made crude remarks about my daughters ass, breast and even had the stones to say he would have sex with her if they weren't related. \n\nBut still when I drove up to his house a few days ago, opened the door and strolled though wondering if he was hurt. I never expected that when daring to push open the cracked bedroom door that my daughter was going be to down on her knees swallowing my own father's cum.\n\nThere were many raging thoughts going though my mind at this point, but in haste, shock and anger my first words were, \"How the fuck could you do this to your own granddaughter?\"\n\nMy daughter sitting on the floor started crying while my father calmly replied, \"Son it's time for you to grow the fuck up. This world runs on the exchange of sex and money. She fucks me, I pay for her sweet ass and tits. That's just how life works in the adult world.\"\n\nJust looking at the pale glaze in his eyes and the smirk he wore proudly on his face was more than enough for me to know he didn't give a damn. Not one single string in his heart forged of stone was pulled. Not one ounce of regret tinged his voice and this enraged me beyond the point of being able to reason. \n\nAfter that I honest to god couldn't think at all, I was furious as a demon from the darkest bowels of hell and smashed the TV off the bedroom wall while swearing him off. Then I tackled him to the bed and I was nearly about to bash his head in with the lamp seated on his nightstand. I have never felt this kind of rage in my whole life, but in that moment on top of him. Nothing seemed more right than acting upon this deep fiery impulse of limitless rage. \n\nMy daughter then quickly hugged me from behind and then begged me to stop while saying she was the one that suggested having sex with him for his help. I couldn't hardly believe it and wanted to know the answers to the million questions running though my mind, but instead I grabbed her and left quickly as I could because this was just too much.\n\nIt took everything I had to avoid crying as I drove us both home. I was drowning with the guilt that I've so horribly failed to protect her from the man that raised me. \n\nUpon coming home we sat on the sofa in the living room and she just broke down crying while holding onto me. I told her she doesn't need to explain what happened until she's ready to talk. But she said I needed to know why this happened and began telling me about how a boyfriend in high school cheated on her.\n\nInstead of coming to me about what happened she went out with my father for lunch and asked him for advice. He told her love is a myth sold to the poor so men can pretend they care about girls while fucking and girls don't feel used. If this wasn't toxic enough he then told her that she is a fool for not trying to exploit the richest guy she can catch.  \n\nWhen I asked why she never talked to me about it. She said I seemed so overprotective that I wouldn't be helpful and believed my father would give her what she needed to hear. Then she explained the relationships she entered upon while in highschool with men from 40-60 years old and how they took her to really expensive places for dinner, bought her high end clothing and gave her an allowance for having sex with them.   \n\nMy father actually told her after catching her first \"sugar daddy\" that he was proud of her for seeing the world for how it is. He bought her a new laptop and praised her for not being a \"dumb blonde\". I actually remember when she came home with it and she had told me my father bought it for her, but I would have never guessed in a million years this was the reason. \n\nThen she talked about collage and how because I couldn't help pay for it that she went to my father asking him to pay. I had advised her against it because when he paid for me going to collage he picked the degree I would pursue and wouldn't consider any alternatives. But she did anyways and at the time I wondered how she talked him into paying for medical school with the goal of being a doctor. \n\nWhen my daughter told me that she went out to the lake behind his house in a bikini swimsuit to tease him into wanting to fuck her after turning 18 my heart sank. She got him to take her out onto his boat and after riding around a bit she jumped into the water. Then coming back out into the boat all wet she got on him and after teasing him asked if he would change his mind about paying for collage if they made a deal with her ass on the table. \n\nBy this point I felt horribly sick, but she had more to tell me so I hugged her and told her not everything needs to be said right now. After a moment passed she told me that she needs me to hear it and that holding it in hurt more. \n\nGetting myself ready for stomach turning horror I asked what he did next. My father told her he would pay for her collage if she had sex with him and no one found out. She also told me that out of the 3 girls he was having regular sex with that she was his favorite. \n\nI already knew my father bragged about being with two women in their 30's and paying young escorts for sex, but I wanted to scream when she told me that a few times he brought in a 20 something girl into the bedroom with her so he could have sex with both of them at the same time. \n\nAfter that she explained becoming depressed and feeling like no man was ever going to love her. So when coming back home from collage she wanted to become more intimate with me. Then she confessed that I was the only one that made her feel secure and didn't want to be with other men.\n\nDespite having prepared for her possibly saying she was interested in a sexual relationship. I was such a mess from processing everything else that it took a while for me to respond. All I knew for sure is she needed a father far more than one more man using her for sex. So I told her I would only prove that old bastard right if we entered a sexual relationship. That I loved her more than I she could know, but then she kissed me on the cheek and said that she needed a man to make love to her that actually cared. \n\nI promised her that I'm not the only good man that exist in the world and what my father sold to her was a world of his own making. That I firmly believe the last thing she needs right now is her own father having sexual relations with her. And that right now we need to focus on healing because what she has been though is really toxic. \n\nAll night I consoled her and tried my best to convince her my father doesn't know real love because he sold his soul climbing the corporate latter to become an executive and clearly has long forgotten compassion. But she's experienced a lot more than I expected and by the time it was time to sleep I felt like a total failure of a father.\n\nShe came into my bedroom that night and wanted to share the bed. I allowed it because she was clearly still very upset and told me she felt guilty over what happened despite me reassuring her about it. The next morning I then decided to call my brother and tell him what happened because he has a young daughter. \n\nBy the time I was done explaining what our father did, he said thank god we don't have a sister and told me he is never going to speak to our father ever again.\n\nI don't think I've been this depressed since my mother died 7 years ago and even then that didn't come with the mixture of anger, bitterness and rage I feel right now toward my father. For what he did to my daughter will scar her for life. \n\nI actually broke down crying in the shower this morning because I had failed to see what was going on despite the signs being practically out in the open. All I could think is how on earth could I have let this happen, how could I have not seen this and why didn't I figure it out sooner. \n\nTonight I'm sitting here wishing I could bear all her pain instead, but all I can do is give her support. Never in my life have I ever felt more powerless or guilty. This happened because I struggled at providing what she needed and made huge error's in parenting. I failed so horribly as a father that she felt her grandfather was the right person to ask about relationships instead and he just played her all the way to his bedroom. It's so deplorable, warped, disgusting and shameful that my own father did this to my daughter. \n\nAll I can do now is help her though day by long day until hopefully healing takes place. But this won't ever go away nor could I ever forget this. And in case it's not clear by now, I will never forgive my father for everything he did. ",

Betrayal is one of the more damaging forms of emotional trauma.\n\nUnfortunately, your daughter has grown up with his worldview for quite a while and it will take years for her to get over it. And even then, she will only be able to heal if she see\u2019s proof of it being wrong. The reason why you see so many people on the Internet with strange ideas about how relationships work is because their loneliness only confirms their beliefs. If you want to help her, you need to make her feel genuinely loved. Considering the circumstances, I don\u2019t trust any man other than you to be able to accomplish that. A lot of other guys at this age in particular tend to be pricks and even though there are a lot of good guys out there, the risk is just too high.\n\nI\u2019m not saying you should have sex her. Truthfully I have no idea what you should do about that (though I am leaning towards no). She might not realize it, but she\u2019s not just asking for a one-time quickie to make herself feel better. She\u2019s going to end up dragging you into a relationship where sex will become a somewhat regular thing. The rest of the details I\u2019m less certain of, I don\u2019t know how far you two would end up going or how you\u2019d eventually end it (if you did choose to end it), but I\u2019m pretty sure all of this is exactly what you\u2019re afraid of.\n\nBefore I leave, I just want to remind you that sex isn\u2019t the be-all-end-all in love and romance. It used to be something that would happen after you already had a loving and successful relationship. Maybe try to see if you can build one with her first, and if you\u2019re lucky she might decide that she doesn\u2019t need sex from you anymore once she feels more confident in herself.\n\nEDIT: Clarified my stance on the whole sex issue cause it seems like I accidentally started an argument.",

The part where he praised her for being a smart girl because she used sex as a commodity to get what she wants?  He gave her a laptop to reward her for this.  Yes, he didn\u2019t have sex with her until she was over 18, but he groomed her into a mindset that using sex to acquire what you want is how she should behave, before she was legal age.  While she was still in a development stage.  And when she was old enough, he willingly took advantage of the girl he molded into the person he could have sex with.  Remember, he stated that he wanted to have sex with her, and he whispered the words that she needed to hear to put her in the best position to give him what he wanted.  That is disgusting.  \n\nConsenting adults?  Yeah, maybe, but the worldview he was pushing was given to her while she was underage and in a vulnerable state.  After her boyfriend broke up with her.  Do you not see how twisted this is?  The harm he did? The manipulation?  Do you think she would have offered sex for tuition if he did not instill in her mind while she was young that this is how she should think?  Of course not.  And in what scenario would the cop take the side of a grandfather having sex with his granddaughter, or not understand her father\u2019s actions?  There is more to this then him programming her while she was underage.  This is still incest, which still happens to be frowned on by society, no matter how we feel about it in this subreddit.  So of course we take the OP\u2019s side!",

After her boyfriend broke up with her.  Do you not see how twisted this is?  The harm he did? The manipulation?  Do you think she would have offered sex for tuition if he did not instill in her mind while she was young that this is how she should think?  Of course not.  And in what scenario would the cop take the side of a grandfather having sex with his granddaughter, or not understand her father\u2019s actions?  There is more to this then him programming her while she was underage.  This is still incest, which still happens to be frowned on by society, no matter how we feel about it in this subreddit.  So of course we take the OP\u2019s side!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
