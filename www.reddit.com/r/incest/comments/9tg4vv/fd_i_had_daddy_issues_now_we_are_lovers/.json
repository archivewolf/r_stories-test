And I thought that I should also give my side of the things.\n\nFirst thing: Why I'm doing this?\n\nBecause I always believed that I was \"sick\", that what I felt was wrong and that I should bury my feelings for the sake of morality. Until, about an year ago I found this community. And I saw that I'm not alone, that there are others like me and reading about other people experiences gave me the courage to go after what I always wanted.\n\nIf what me and daddy wrote here help even one other person like me, it was worth to stop being just a lurker and exposing my feelings.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, as daddy said on the other posts, we were always very close. He, his mother and sister (my granny and aunt) are the only close family that I have.\n\nSince I was little, I knew I loved him very much. Even when I was a child, I knew there was something more, that what I felt seemed different from what other girls felt when they talked about their dads.\n\nWhen I hit puberty I realized, I loved him not just as my dad, more than anything, he was my man, always there for me, sacrificing everything for my sake. On the front, he was this stone-cold-manly-unshakeable-badass-motherfucker. But deep down, he's the sweetest, gentlest and caring man. The first time I \"touched myself\" (and many more after that) I was thinking about daddy. Every time he leaved for the night, I hated it, why he had to go out after these old bitches? Why couldn't he stay with me? All these feelings made me burn inside, sometimes lust, sometimes hate and, at worst, empty... If I'm allowed to be poetic, a carousel of agony.\n\nBut I also believed it to be wrong, that I was some kind of sick, depraved, immoral girl, lusting after her own father. So I bottled it. Hid it the best I could while also enjoying our moments together, every hug he give me, every kiss, every time I could peek at him leaving the shower still kinda wet, just in his briefs, when I could just lay on his chest while watching TV.\n\nI tried to move on with my sex life. I always saw boys my own age as stupid and beneath me and, while I was attracted by older men, I also felt like if I was betraying daddy if I gone after it. So I started dating girls. I'm attracted to girls too, so being lesbian was like my \"sexual escape goat\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis changed about an year ago, when lurking on reddit, I found this sub. It took some time, but after reading some posts here, I finally found the courage to try something.\n\nDaddy was always very open-minded, so I thought that, at worst, if I played it smoothly, he would scold me.\n\nI started reading about how to get a sugar daddy (I'm not proud of it and when I confessed this to daddy, he was quite disappointed). It was around March this year, I started getting more \"touchy\", hugging and kissing him more, I got back to calling him daddy, I changed the way I dressed around the house, I started talking against his dates.\n\nAt first I didn't saw any reaction, but on the last months I noticed it: He was uncomfortable. I did it, I was hitting something, he noticed me someway.\n\nUntil it came the day.\n\nDad confronted me.\n\nAnd it all changed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'll leave it here for today. I'll continue with everything that happened and how our relation is going currently on another post.\n\nFor your info, he knows I'm writing this, although he doesn't like the idea of sharing more, he read everything before I posted. We're also currently seeing a therapist for counseling.",
