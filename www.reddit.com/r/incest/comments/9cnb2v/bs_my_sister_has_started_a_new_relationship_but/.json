She met and married someone a couple years after our separation, while I had numerous relationships until I met my wife a handful of years ago. My sister's ex-husband died, but not before pressuring her to reconnect with me. My wife and I had my sister move in with us more than a year after my sister's ex-husband died. My wife became good friends with my sister after living with us for a year. My wife knew of our past, is bisexual, and is very into incest. My wife and I allowed my sister into our bedroom with some hesitation on my end. I was hesitant because I felt my sister was still vulnerable, and it I who ended things with her in our teens. My sister never really stopped desiring me.\n\nLess than a year ago, my sister was pursued by a co-worker and decided to accept his advances. I ended the physical relationship she had with my wife and me when she started dating. I wanted her to have a real chance at a happy, stable relationship, and I didn't want to be a party to her cheating on anyone. She relentlessly made me a party of cheating in our teens, either she pursued me while she was dating or pursued me while I was dating. She couldn't see anything monogamous with me, but she always wanted me. I eventually found some self control and wanted to try to have stable relationships without my sister sabotaging them.\n\nMy sister is practically living with her co-worker now, but she has admitted it is hard to be around me without wanting to be physical with me. She says I am like some sort of drug for her, and it hurts when I won't reciprocate anything physical.\n\nI'm trying to figure out the best option for sorting this out. I have an adult daughter from a relationship I tried to have in my teens. My sister helped raise my daughter, and they are very close. My sister can't have children of her own, so my daughter is like her daughter too. My wife understands my situation, has refused any physical advances from my sister also, but doesn't want to lose a good friend. Consensual adult incest isn't criminal in my state, but it isn't legal either. I hesitate about talking to my therapist about it for legal reasons. It would be wrong to force my sister out of my life, and my wife and daughter would fight me over that even if I considered it. I am just at a loss. I don't really think I am going to find any good answers, but I could use some opinions.",
