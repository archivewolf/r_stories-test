I don\u2019t use reddit much but I\u2019m using a throwaway account as I feel its for the best. \n\nI am 48 and the Father of two young lads, I\u2019m also a loving husband and I\u2019ve been married for over 15 years. I met my wife young and we\u2019ve never even had a slight disagreement let alone argument. \n\nWe are what, in some ways you\u2019d call a perfect happy family. My wife (43) is a stay at home mother/housewife and I own my own business. As far as our relationship goes, we\u2019re very happy, she\u2019s still stunning, she\u2019s always been very petite so hasn\u2019t lost her figure just the slight appearance of wrinkles etc.\n\nOur boys are good fellas too, both responsible, friendly and have always been well behaved. My eldest is just a hideaway in his room, very computer orientated, he only eats dinner with us and watches the occasional movie. The younger of the two is much more of a mother\u2019s boy and always has been. (This is where the concern comes from). When he was younger we\u2019d do typical boy stuff, fishing, playing catch and video games etc. However now he is home for the summer a lot, he has focused all his attention on his mother and visa-versa. \n\nNow with the prelude over, the past few weeks have felt weird for me, I often work very late, recently I\u2019ve been sleeping at the office because I was going to merge my business but now it might fall through it\u2019s a mess. The time I have spent at home whenever I see my wife and my youngest they are inseparable, he is also acting very inappropriately around his mother. Last week we watched a movie together on the sofa, naturally he sat next to his mother but halfway through he was stroking her thigh, she didn\u2019t seem to mind but I felt uncomfortable about it all. \n\nI guess there wasn\u2019t much else to base my suspicions on as I was not there a lot of the time. However, one night during the end of last week I decided to actually go home. I rocked up into the garage pretty late, usually everyone would be in bed. Unfortunately, they weren\u2019t, I entered the kitchen and walked towards the living room but I heard the TV on and a movie or something playing, I presumed that my wife or sons had fallen asleep watching it, due to my prior suspicions I peeked in the door (for context it\u2019s a sliding screen door thing) I saw movement on the sofa. \n\nThis is the part that I am not sure on as I may be in denial, I guess I hold a shred of hope that I\u2019m sleep deprived and saw things. But either way this is what I witnessed in as blunt terms as I can muster. \n\nTwo people, one of which is definitely my wife were under a thin blanket. My wife was being drilled, she was moaning gently and had a grasp of his ass, pulling him into her, there were sounds that resembled a gentle wet slapping, and her feet were in the air flopping around. \n\nI have no doubt this was my son having sex with his mother. \n\nSo far, I haven\u2019t confronted anyone on this, as far as my wife and son\u2019s know, I was at my office. I slept in my car that night and went in the next morning. My wife was washing clothing which was odd as she always does her wash the same day every week. \n\nJust need reassurance that I am not completely insane here?  ",

Another option is join in when your son is fucking, so it an open thing and not disrespectful. He might be a young stud full of lust. \nThere is a root to all incest. I know mine and my boundaries.

I made it very clear to her that lying was pointless, and I simply want to know who it's with and why she has done it. \n\nMy wife spent the next few minutes in silence until she finally opened up. \n\nShe has told me everything, and well, I'm no Edgar Allen Poe but I'll try and document it as well as possible. \n\nEssentially my wife is having a sexual relationship with both our sons. It's been going on for the past 4 months give or take. It started with the youngest and then developed with the oldest, she said that she feels a large maternal connection and just enjoys making them happy. She said obviously she gets sexual gratification and that does help as I'm barely there. She reassuraed me that she wasn't blaming me and that she does feel terrible but thought I'd go off the rails if she told me. \n\nApparently it all started when my youngest son was getting bullied in school, one thing led to another and they began a sexual relationship. She then began to sleep with our oldest son after a \"slightly drunken mistake\" \n\nI was curious and asked about the sex, she said it's very enjoyable but she didn't want to share many more details. \n\nI explained that it must be hard with me barely there, and I know she's a good mother, I said I found it disturbing but I guess it's better than the mailman. \n\nTruth be told it didn't bother me as much as I thought it would now that I know the truth. \n\nWe spoke for a few hours and decided that she should stop.
