My name's Steve. I'm 22, married, living the dream. Recently my family adopted a girl, Carly. Carly is 18. She was a distant relative prior to the adoption and was adopted due to so issues within her family. Ever since her adoption things have been strange.\n\nPrior to the adoption we had seen each other once every few years at family get-togethers with little issue. There was no romatic involement then as far as I see it. However once she was adopted things seemed to change, maybe it was being in closer proximity, I'm not sure. She immediately started talking about how she had cherished the times we had together in the past and talked of her greatest memories involving us. These memories aren't any that I remember too well, and just involved me doing things I would to anyone else, teaching a skill, swinging on a swingset etc. A few weeks after teh adoption I noticed her hugs had got tighter and longer and she seemed to be very much so about kissing me on the cheek any chance she got. Snooping through her diary I found that she had written that she liked me but it didn't go into detail about in what capacity. My wife says she mentioned to her once that she would totally date me if I weren't married which led me to believe she means in a romantic way.\n\nMonths go by and the hugging and cheek kissing continues on. I brush it off as just her being weird to be honest. Then a few nights ago I had a dream that I caught her dry humping another girl. In this dream I told her how she needed to quit and act like a grown up now. She said she couldn't help it, she's just horny all the time. I said I know and that I was hard all the time too, but you have to learn to control it. Somehow we ended up in blockbuster and she asked what we should do about our mutual horniness and I said I think you know what, but you have to promise to keep it a secret. She said okay and we talked dirty in blockbuster for a bit. She got worried that our mother caught wind, but we came up with some excuse. A few moments later we were doing the deed and I woke up wet.\n\nThis whole thing got me to thinking about how affectionate she had been and wondering if this is an experience I should maybe explore. I have worries about her not wanting too, or not keeping it a secret now or later and ruining my relationships with my wife and other family members.\n\nThey are coming over in the coming days and I already thought about taking just her to the library under the guise of trying to gain some quality time with her, but I don't know how to bring any of this up, or how to find out if I can trust her if something does develop.\n\nAny advice for the whole situation is appreciated.\n\nYes I said Blockbuster. Get over it, it was a dream.",
