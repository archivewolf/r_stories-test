I've raised her alone, actually, with a lot of help from my mom and sis. I got her mother pregnant when she was 17, and she bailed out as soon as she could, our daughter was about 6 months old when she left.\n\nMe and my daughter always lived together. Until about 6 years ago we lived in my mother's house. We slept in the same room, but in separated beds. Then I bought a 2 bedroom apartment for us, so since then she has her own room.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**About my daughter:**\n\nShe started college this year, focusing only in her studies.\n\nShe is very socially anxious. Geeky, japanese culture fan, kinda in the cringy side. Never had much friends. I try to share her interests and hobbies to get as close as possible from her, even used to took her to anime conventions when she was younger, even tough I secretly hated those.\n\nShe always helped my mom with the house chores when we lived with her. But since we started living on our own, she took to herself most of the house chores, like cooking, laundry and some light cleaning, although I pay to a cleaning lady to do the heavy stuff 2x month.\n\nI find her very beautiful, but to be sincere, my opinion is 100% biased, I've been told she is actually quite out of the \"beauty standard\".\n\nShe never shown much interest in boys, and I blame myself for raising her kinda tomboyish. About 3 years ago she came out to me as a lesbian. I was super supportive, saying that if that was what made her happy, go for it and that I would always be there to help her in anything she needed, even shared some flirting tips, if that helped her somehow. About 2 years ago she even brought a girlfriend home, introduced her to me and everything. But they broke up soon after.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**About me:**\n\nI'm a handyman. Mostly electric and hydraulic repairs. It's a hard job, but it got us our home and is paying her college, so it's everything I could ask.\n\nI try to stay in shape, going to the gym 3-4x a month. I get some female attention, and believe myself to be above the average.\n\nAbout my romantic life, I keep it out of the house, never brought a woman home. Mostly because I would hate to see some other woman telling my daughter what to do or mistreating her.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I love my daughter from the bottom of my hearth, but I made a vasectomy about 15 years ago, I'm not making the same mistake again.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**About our relation:**\n\nWe've always been very close. As I said, 'till she was 13, we lived in the same room and, even tough she always had her own bed, she would almost always wanted to sleep with me. Even after I got our home, she would ask to sleep with me, I let it 'till she was about 15.\n\nWe are very touchy-felly, she always came to me about her problems, although some times I would call her aunt or granny to have a \"girl talk\", sometimes I also speak to her about my problems and feelings, but trying the best I can to keep the \"Macho-Tough\" image. We always did the usual daddy-daughter stuff like cuddling, leaning on my shoulder as we watch TV (we love to binge watch series together), massaging her head and shoulder, smooching (it's quite common in our country for family members to give a little peck on the lips), although I stopped with the smooching when she got older.\n\nI always called her by cute names, things that would translate as sweetie, darling, pumpkin. When she was little, she would call me something that translated would be like daddy, but about 7 years ago she started to change it to just dad.\n\nWe live in a country which is hot almost all year around, so, at home, I usually hang out shirtless, and she used to wear short nightgowns.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The Problems:**\n\nIt all started by the beginning of the year.\n\nFirst thing I noticed, she turned back to calling me something like daddy, sometimes even trying to sound coy or even childish.\n\nWe usually go out together grocery shopping, see a movie or just a trip to a park or mall. Sometimes women come on to me flirting (usually I flirt back, but never when my daughter is around, in this case I try to dismiss then as politely as possible), she was always annoyed by that, but from the start of the year from now, she got very vocal against that, even to the point of telling one of these women to fuck off. When I confronted her about it she replied: \"These old hags are beneath you\".\n\nAlso, she never liked to much when I got out at night. But again, she started being very vocal about it, saying that \"I shouldn't hang out with old bitches\", and things like that. (I date women around my age).\n\nShe would sometimes have a \"girl that is just a friend\" when I drove her to and from conventions, or when she would hang out with her friends. But I noticed that she doesn't has anymore. I've even asked her close friends (two boys that are a gay couple) if she was seeing someone lately, and they said no.\n\nShe changed her attire when at home also. Now she usually goes with short shorts and tight cropped shirts or even just panties and bra. Sometimes I also use just briefs, so I never said anything against it. Until last week, I came home from work and she was cooking dinner with just an apron and panties. When I confronted her, she dismissed it saying it was to hot and she didn't want to turn the AC on, as the utility bills are getting to high.\n\nWhen we watch TV she would usually lean on my shoulder, but now she moved to leaning on my lap, and I believe she even tried to \"cup a fell\" brushing her head against my crotch.\n\nThe \"ultimate red flag\" was 4 days ago. I came back from the gym and she complimented me:\n\n\"You're getting even more handsome. You're totally a DILF.\"\n\nBy then I didn't know what that was so I asked her.\n\n\"You know what a MILF is, right?\"\n\n\"Yeah.\"\n\n\"It's like that, but instead of a mom is a daddy.\"\n\nThere was a very uncomfortable silence after that and we didn't touch the subject anymore.\n\nAside from that, she's got clingier than before.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***Now the thing is:***\n\nThis is killing me. I have no one to talk this to. I don't want to have to talk to her trough a psychiatrist. After searching online about this, this is the best place I found to at least vent this out.\n\nI'm I seeing to much? Overreacting? And if not...\n\nI love her, very much. When her mother abandoned her I swore to myself I would protect and be the there for her no matter what. She's the most important person in my life. She's the reason I strive to be the best and work harder, to give her the opportunities I didn't had.\n\nI'm not against the idea of incest. I believe that what consenting adults do in their private life is their own problem. BUT SHE'S MY DAUGHTER, FOR FUCKSAKES! I raised her! I've seen her grown into a woman!\n\nI don't want to hurt her feelings, make her feel bad. She's already very socially anxious and I don't want to worsen it. I also don't want to spoil our relationship, she's very important to me and I don't want to see her getting away from me because something like that. That's the main reason I haven't done much against her \"advances\" until now.\n\nAnd, hell, if she can seduce her own father, she can seduce anyone, right? If I give in to her, would I be helping her? Make her feel more secure about herself? Shit. The truth is that I just don't fucking know what to do.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat's it. I don't know if someone will read this, but, been able to at least put this out in the open already helps a little.",
