Some details have changed for obvious reasons; I feel as though I need to keep some things private just in case. This is going to be a long post so strap in and get comfortable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFirst things first, I, William, but they call me Liam, am a 24 year old male, and I live in the south west. I played sports all my life, and still go to the gym everyday before I go to work, which is also very physically demanding. I am about 6 feet 2 inches tall 230 pounds and have a thick athletic build ( I played linebacker and fullback in football to put it in perspective ), but I do train a lot of cardio, so, trying to not sound too conceded here, I am muscular.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow to the part where I am assuming most of you are wondering. Riley (Fake name, again for obvious reasons) is a my age too, 5' 6ish built similar to an Anna Kendrick, or Emma Stone body type, and has long dark brown hair probably 120 lbs soaking wet, but has an incredible body, I think it is beautiful, but I am a little biased. TBH she looks a little like Anna Kendrick, with the skinny nose and pointed chin that she has as well.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy family has always had a way with each other to put simply. You get too many of them in the same room, and its not pretty. With that being said, it explains why I did not know I had cousins and aunts and uncle until around 16 years old. Basically there was a massive, knock-out, lingering fight between my grandmother and her adult children. It took forever for the family to get back together. Fast forward many years and you get the situation that is what I am coming to this subreddit for.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow that we have all the basics out of the way, lets get started on the actual story. I was in high-school at the time it all starts and very busy with sports, school, work, and trying to balance a personal life on top of all of that. If I wanted to be able to pay for gas, insurance, car, have a cell phone, have money to be independent etc. I had to get a job, which I did asap. I started out bagging groceries and working on the weekends when I could. Honestly, I hated it, but I loved that it gave me freedom to be able to do what I wanted in my free time. Then I get a text from my uncle who owns a restaurant (I should state that he had recently started going to my football games and we would always go out for dinner as a family after games, he played football also and we would talk for hours about game plans and real technical aspects of the game over text and around the dinner table) saying \"You want to make $100?\". Immediately, I was in! Seriously anything beat bagging groceries for $7.50 an hour. I asked what i was doing and he said one of his employees called out and he needed a dish pit guy for the night. Me being a 18 year old with nothing better to do, jumped at the thought of $100 for 7 hours of working. Little did I know, I quickly knew why he quit.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(Bear with me I promise there is a reason for all this backstory)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was absolute hell to say the least. Its about 95 degrees with a constant spray of commercial dishwasher detergent and other chemicals; half eaten food in a full trash can to my left; feet soaked in what I hoped was water, but knew was not, it was all sorts of grease, drinks and who knows what. By the end of the night, I find out it was one of his busiest nights he has ever had, and he really appreciated that I was able to help. After the kitchen closed I stayed around for a bit while my uncle talked to me about making this a weekly thing. As we were talking, my eyes wandered as they usually do. Hey, what can I say, I am a 18 year-old hormone raging teenage boy; can you blame me?. My uncle had some good looking servers on the floor and behind the bar.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast-forward a couple months and this is a weekly event. I actually quit my other job because he offered me more hours and it worked well with my schedule. My hours varied, but they were always weekend shifts and if there was Monday holiday or if I had the week off from school etc, basically if i wanted more hours I just had to ask and there was always something he would have me do. While working there I didn't say much other than to my uncle and all the amigos in the back (Think of the typical line cook kitchen, 5 to 6 amigo and then me, the gringo, essentially). I would go in do my job close down the kitchen, hang out for a bit, then go to whatever plans me and the group from high-school had that night. I would still have eyes that would wander all throughout the night and there were a few co-workers I found attractive but I know they were all many years older then me (they would be making plans to go to the bars after work etc), Still there were some I knew were close to my age that I would always freeze up and never got the nerve to talk to because, to put bluntly, I get nervous and flustered. I was not the smooth one back then, and still think I am a little awkward in a bar scene, its just not my place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne day I get a text from my uncle asking if i was at the restaurant, It was a Friday and I said i was about to pull in, he asks me if i wanted to ditch work because it was going to be a super slow night and if i wanted I could just get some food with him. I didn't particularly need the money, so I said sure. I met him at buffalo wild wings, and we sat down and were discussing everything under the sun. He looks down at his phone and said \"You mind if the family joins?\" I reply with \"Do I have a say in this?\" to which he says \"Not really\". We are always being smart asses to each other, and still do to this day; its always light-hearted, and is a comic relief from the day to day bulls\\*\\*\\*. Well, they walk up and I meet the family for the first real time ( there was a time when i was really little so i am not counting that) I met My Aunt, My cousin Riley, and my cousin Jonah. Well as it turns out, Riley is the one I had definitely noticed while working; I just never knew that she was my cousin. We immediately clicked, and were talking saying how could you work there for months and not say anything!? We all got a kick out of it. My uncle just assumed we knew and never formally introduced us. Later that night I remember thinking that even though she was my cousin I was still attracted to her, even if it was just physically. After that I came out of my shell a little and was more sociable at work. and was talking to the serving staff, food runners and bartenders quite regularly. All the while I still found Riley incredibly attractive. Every now and then we would all go to your 24 hour restaurants and get some food after work and hang out. This goes on till I graduate high-school. All the while I am dating and having fun in high school etc., but I still find Riley extremely attractive, but I know it was something i would never act on, or so I thought.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI get into the contracting field working on commercial buildings and I do that for about 2 years and do very well, but we got bought out and basically absolved. For the hell of it, I go back and ask my uncle if he needs some help around the restaurant and he says he needs a bartender, like yesterday. I tell him I don't know a damn thing about it, but I'm willing to learn. So now I am back at my uncles place and it turns into a full time gig pretty quickly; I am a quick learner and I did enjoy bartending. In my time away I notice Riley has really taken a leadership role around there. She basically spend most of her free time there and it really showed. She was young, but no-one ever had a problem with what she would ask of them. So now she was extremely attractive and a strong willed and determined woman. I now found her even more attractive. Well as it turns out I end up starting to talk to one of the servers right around the same time Riley starts dating one of them too; I can't remember who started dating who first. Don't think of it as a spiteful way to get back at each other, these thoughts were strictly in my head and we were not flirting or anything like that, we would just talk like people in the service industry do. Anyways, I dated Samantha for about 3 years, and in that time I left the bar scene behind. I did not like the hours and I did not see it as a career just something to do that pays well if you know how to play the field. Well, me and Samantha ended quite climatically. To put simply, I like my women like I like my coffee, without my best friend's (at the time) dick in it. While all that was happening, Me and Riley still talked and would text and see each other at family events etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward again to about 4 months ago. The story start to pick up now, everything else up to this point was backstory and trying to paint the most accurate picture I can. Riley texts me out of the blue, up till that point it had been about a month since we had talked, asking if I could help her move to her new place. I do like helping and when someone is in need, I will at least make an attempt to help them. I once heard someone say, \"You can pick your friends, underwear and nose, but you can not pick your family\", that stuck with me. With some one the events mentioned before and a few more family events that transpired within the past few years it makes you put things in perspective. While I absolutely despise moving other people stuff or my stuff for that matter, it was for family, and hell at least I would get some eye-candy out of it. Well moving turned out about as awesome as I planned ( I know sarcasm is hard to show over text but i assure you this is an extreme case). It was about 100 degrees outside, humid and to top it all off the place she was renting did not have the a/c working at the time. Some of the many reasons I hate moving; I always am the one lifting the beds freezers dressers etc. Well we get it done eventually and she is extremely thankful buys me a 12 pack and we finally just relax for a little bit that night. We start talking catching up and shooting the shit. I had heard that she broke up with her longtime boyfriend, she dated this guy for a while and he was quickly going nowhere with his life and they changed as people and they separated. I told her about my per\"dick\"ament with the last relationship (she started really laughing at that one). She was asking questions and I was answering honestly. Truthfully she was the first person I talked to about the ex. She asked if I was okay. I told her when something like that happens its the abuse of trust and the fact that someone could go shopping for a ring with someone all the while she is fucking your best friend while you are working 14 hours a day to try and provide a future for both of you ( As you can see, this still brings up a few emotions). I was telling her about all of this. Telling her how I don't plan on dating for a while, but something that is less serious and more satisfying urges is what I would be interested in. She was just listening, which was perfect because she did just that, listen, no judging or anything like that. She responded with, that exactly what I am doing right now. Not even dating just doing me, trying to advance my career working on myself etc. Before we know it, its midnight and we both have work in the morning. I give her a hug tell her goodnight, pretty uneventful.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell over the next month I am over there pretty often, Helping where I can. Hanging t.v.'s, building bookcases, unpacking whatever it may be. Honestly I liked it, just hanging out with Riley, it did not matter what we were doing. (Another tidbit of info while I remember, I never saw Riley as a family member first, I saw her as a co-worker first, because that is how I first met her, then she became family through the events that occurred. As you all have read, I am attracted to people I work with, its just who I am. I will add that the taboo of her being my cousin in a huge turn-on.) Well we get pretty comfortable around each other and we had just got back from a shopping trip to pick out some clothes for her new job, and she was going to a concert afterwards. We had been outside all day and I was going to take the dog out and feed him while she went to go take a shower to help her out because we had run over on time. I am in the living room and the water has been turned off for a while and I hear her putting on makeup and using the blow-dryer all the female things you girls do. I hear the door open and i see her walk out. I still remember what she was wearing. She walks up to me wearing a very tight fitting t-shirt dress, but what really got me is I can see her piercings (were not talking about ears here boys and girls). Oddly enough, I had another ex that had her nipples pierced and at first I thought I was not going to like them. Well it turns out I fucking love them! Seriously now that I know what it's like, its a real turn on. I stumble through the question and immediately get aroused which makes me more flustered ( Like I said before, I am not smooth when it comes to women). she turns around and I cant help but to watch her walk away. She goes back into the bathroom to put on the rest of her jewelry and makeup. I can tell she is about to get ready to head out so i decide not to be told to leave and say I'm going to head out. She walks out this time with her face put on (either way she looks gorgeous) and gives me a hug. Just for my clarification I run my hand up her back when i give her a hug just to make sure i wasn't seeing things and she really wasn't wearing a bra. My hands felt nothing but the back of my cousin and it just makes me that much more turned on. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMore recently, Just about every Saturday night I crash over at her place to watch her dog because she is babysitting, nannying etc. Again I don't mind, I like helping. Most times I just bring clothes with me to work and head over there as soon as I leave from work and take a shower over there. well I walk in and I see her dog say hey to him and just start unwinding from the work week. I get a beer from the fridge and take him out and feed him. I open the bathroom and can't help but notice the clothes hamper with a deep red bra and cheeky boy shorts not on top of the hamper but definitely enough of it showing to know exactly what that bra looks like. I told her i was going to take a shower over there so i don't know if she just overlooked it or if it was more on purpose. Either way I was in heaven. She is just about as busy as me ( Has a career 9-5 job, M-F, then other things on the side, I work 8-8 M-F), and I know we are very comfortable around each other. We go out for dinner and a movie, For all intents and purposes it would be a date if it were with anyone other than her, hell, at what point do you stop calling it a date and its just hanging out because I am new to all this attracted to your cousin on a more than physical level?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe other day we were talking and she asked if I was going to be able to make it over to her house and I was planning on it. She said there are sheets next to her bed if i wanted to put them on, she said her dog has been sleeping with her lately so if i wanted to change them it would be fine because when she is gone he gets on the bed. I told her to stop treating me as a guest and I assured her it was fine. She was saying her dog gets dirty outside then goes straight to the bed. I told her its probably not as dirty as some of the guys she brings home ( I thought that was a good one, btw that's how we joke with each other. ), and she retorted with her dog would not allow that; which I believe. He is a very protective of her. What I am getting at with all this is, is she by chance training her dog to see me as something he is protective over too, to potentially have me stay over? She only has one bed and a couch that needs a steam clean so that not happening. Also If any of you out there have any recommendations or questions let me know, I should be checking this nightly and would love some of your thoughts and opinions on this. I would love to pursue this on a lustful level. ",

All the while I still found Riley incredibly attractive. Every now and then we would all go to your 24 hour restaurants and get some food after work and hang out. This goes on till I graduate high-school. All the while I am dating and having fun in high school etc., but I still find Riley extremely attractive, but I know it was something i would never act on, or so I thought.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I get into the contracting field working on commercial buildings and I do that for about 2 years and do very well, but we got bought out and basically absolved. For the hell of it, I go back and ask my uncle if he needs some help around the restaurant and he says he needs a bartender, like yesterday. I tell him I don&amp;#39;t know a damn thing about it, but I&amp;#39;m willing to learn. So now I am back at my uncles place and it turns into a full time gig pretty quickly; I am a quick learner and I did enjoy bartending. In my time away I notice Riley has really taken a leadership role around there. She basically spend most of her free time there and it really showed. She was young, but no-one ever had a problem with what she would ask of them. So now she was extremely attractive and a strong willed and determined woman. I now found her even more attractive. Well as it turns out I end up starting to talk to one of the servers right around the same time Riley starts dating one of them too; I can&amp;#39;t remember who started dating who first. Don&amp;#39;t think of it as a spiteful way to get back at each other, these thoughts were strictly in my head and we were not flirting or anything like that, we would just talk like people in the service industry do. Anyways, I dated Samantha for about 3 years, and in that time I left the bar scene behind. I did not like the hours and I did not see it as a career just something to do that pays well if you know how to play the field. Well, me and Samantha ended quite climatically. To put simply, I like my women like I like my coffee, without my best friend&amp;#39;s (at the time) dick in it. While all that was happening, Me and Riley still talked and would text and see each other at family events etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fast forward again to about 4 months ago. The story start to pick up now, everything else up to this point was backstory and trying to paint the most accurate picture I can. Riley texts me out of the blue, up till that point it had been about a month since we had talked, asking if I could help her move to her new place. I do like helping and when someone is in need, I will at least make an attempt to help them. I once heard someone say, &amp;quot;You can pick your friends, underwear and nose, but you can not pick your family&amp;quot;, that stuck with me. With some one the events mentioned before and a few more family events that transpired within the past few years it makes you put things in perspective. While I absolutely despise moving other people stuff or my stuff for that matter, it was for family, and hell at least I would get some eye-candy out of it. Well moving turned out about as awesome as I planned ( I know sarcasm is hard to show over text but i assure you this is an extreme case). It was about 100 degrees outside, humid and to top it all off the place she was renting did not have the a/c working at the time. Some of the many reasons I hate moving; I always am the one lifting the beds freezers dressers etc. Well we get it done eventually and she is extremely thankful buys me a 12 pack and we finally just relax for a little bit that night. We start talking catching up and shooting the shit. I had heard that she broke up with her longtime boyfriend, she dated this guy for a while and he was quickly going nowhere with his life and they changed as people and they separated. I told her about my per&amp;quot;dick&amp;quot;ament with the last relationship (she started really laughing at that one). She was asking questions and I was answering honestly. Truthfully she was the first person I talked to about the ex. She asked if I was okay. I told her when something like that happens its the abuse of trust and the fact that someone could go shopping for a ring with someone all the while she is fucking your best friend while you are working 14 hours a day to try and provide a future for both of you ( As you can see, this still brings up a few emotions). I was telling her about all of this. Telling her how I don&amp;#39;t plan on dating for a while, but something that is less serious and more satisfying urges is what I would be interested in. She was just listening, which was perfect because she did just that, listen, no judging or anything like that. She responded with, that exactly what I am doing right now. Not even dating just doing me, trying to advance my career working on myself etc. Before we know it, its midnight and we both have work in the morning. I give her a hug tell her goodnight, pretty uneventful.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well over the next month I am over there pretty often, Helping where I can. Hanging t.v.&amp;#39;s, building bookcases, unpacking whatever it may be. Honestly I liked it, just hanging out with Riley, it did not matter what we were doing. (Another tidbit of info while I remember, I never saw Riley as a family member first, I saw her as a co-worker first, because that is how I first met her, then she became family through the events that occurred. As you all have read, I am attracted to people I work with, its just who I am. I will add that the taboo of her being my cousin in a huge turn-on.) Well we get pretty comfortable around each other and we had just got back from a shopping trip to pick out some clothes for her new job, and she was going to a concert afterwards. We had been outside all day and I was going to take the dog out and feed him while she went to go take a shower to help her out because we had run over on time. I am in the living room and the water has been turned off for a while and I hear her putting on makeup and using the blow-dryer all the female things you girls do. I hear the door open and i see her walk out. I still remember what she was wearing. She walks up to me wearing a very tight fitting t-shirt dress, but what really got me is I can see her piercings (were not talking about ears here boys and girls). Oddly enough, I had another ex that had her nipples pierced and at first I thought I was not going to like them. Well it turns out I fucking love them! Seriously now that I know what it&amp;#39;s like, its a real turn on. I stumble through the question and immediately get aroused which makes me more flustered ( Like I said before, I am not smooth when it comes to women). she turns around and I cant help but to watch her walk away. She goes back into the bathroom to put on the rest of her jewelry and makeup. I can tell she is about to get ready to head out so i decide not to be told to leave and say I&amp;#39;m going to head out. She walks out this time with her face put on (either way she looks gorgeous) and gives me a hug. Just for my clarification I run my hand up her back when i give her a hug just to make sure i wasn&amp;#39;t seeing things and she really wasn&amp;#39;t wearing a bra. My hands felt nothing but the back of my cousin and it just makes me that much more turned on. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;More recently, Just about every Saturday night I crash over at her place to watch her dog because she is babysitting, nannying etc. Again I don&amp;#39;t mind, I like helping. Most times I just bring clothes with me to work and head over there as soon as I leave from work and take a shower over there. well I walk in and I see her dog say hey to him and just start unwinding from the work week. I get a beer from the fridge and take him out and feed him. I open the bathroom and can&amp;#39;t help but notice the clothes hamper with a deep red bra and cheeky boy shorts not on top of the hamper but definitely enough of it showing to know exactly what that bra looks like. I told her i was going to take a shower over there so i don&amp;#39;t know if she just overlooked it or if it was more on purpose. Either way I was in heaven. She is just about as busy as me ( Has a career 9-5 job, M-F, then other things on the side, I work 8-8 M-F), and I know we are very comfortable around each other. We go out for dinner and a movie, For all intents and purposes it would be a date if it were with anyone other than her, hell, at what point do you stop calling it a date and its just hanging out because I am new to all this attracted to your cousin on a more than physical level?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The other day we were talking and she asked if I was going to be able to make it over to her house and I was planning on it. She said there are sheets next to her bed if i wanted to put them on, she said her dog has been sleeping with her lately so if i wanted to change them it would be fine because when she is gone he gets on the bed. I told her to stop treating me as a guest and I assured her it was fine. She was saying her dog gets dirty outside then goes straight to the bed. I told her its probably not as dirty as some of the guys she brings home ( I thought that was a good one, btw that&amp;#39;s how we joke with each other. ), and she retorted with her dog would not allow that; which I believe. He is a very protective of her. What I am getting at with all this is, is she by chance training her dog to see me as something he is protective over too, to potentially have me stay over? She only has one bed and a couch that needs a steam clean so that not happening. Also If any of you out there have any recommendations or questions let me know, I should be checking this nightly and would love some of your thoughts and opinions on this. I would love to pursue this on a lustful level. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
