                        "selftext": "As per the rules, I'll keep the backstory vague and just say that we were all teens when it started.\n\nMy older sis and I had always teased and flirted more than was probably normal for siblings. One night she and I got into our dad's liquor cabinet and the teasing and flirting turned into sex. It wasn't the first time for either of us, but be both agreed that it was better than any we'd ever had before and we saw no reason not to do it again. A while later, older sis decided that she wanted to try girls and convinced our younger sis to join us. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOur parents worked nights and older sis was in college but still living at home. Every night after our parents left for work, the three of us would all meet up in one of our bedrooms to have sex in every possible way a guy and two girls can. This continued until Older sis graduated and moved to a larger school to get her master's degree. For awhile we all still played together when she would come home to visit but eventually she got a real serious with a boyfriend and decided she was done with our incestuous relationship. She joined one or both of us a few times after that, usually after a breakup or fight with her significant other (and while drunk) but that was it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLittle sis and I never quit. Even when we were dating other people and eventually both got married, we'd still hook up behind their backs. Several times we decided that we should end it, but those decisions never lasted more and a month. We toyed with the idea of making acceptance of our relationship a requirement for future spouses, but abandoned that after one disastrous incident when she mentioned it to a boyfriend and he freaked out. She eventually convinced him that she had just been trying to turn him on by talking dirty and it was only a fantasy she sometimes entertained. We're not sure if he entirely bought it but he never said anything to anyone that we know of. He broke up with her a short while later and she's convinced it was because of the incest comment. After that we agreed that we had to continue to keep it a secret. Every now and then Sis and I would hook up with another guy or girl we met online for a threesome, but we never told them that we were siblings.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs I said, we both eventually married. Both of those marriages are over. It's not that we didn't both lover our spouses, but we also couldn't ignore the fact that we loved each other too. For a long time our sexual relationship had been just about sex. We loved each other, obviously, but even though we were having sex, it was just brotherly/ sisterly love. It was not romantic. Or maybe it was and we just didn't realize it. I don't know.  It's hard to describe the odd mash up of sexual and familial feelings that I've experienced with her. In the beginning, it never would have occurred to either of us to be jealous when the other one went on a date or had sex with someone else. I would feel protective of her like a good big brother should, but never jealous. Somewhere along the line that changed. Neither of us can really say when but I think I became aware of it after we'd both been married and started families. Maybe we got married because we were still striving for that societal norm of a non-incestuous relationship, a home, and kids? Then once we got those things, we realized that they weren't what we really wanted? Or maybe our marriages just failed because we were both cheating and you can't make a marriage work that way regardless of who your cheating with? Sorry. I'm rambling. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe point being that both of us are divorced now. Our ex's never found out we were cheating and we didn't leave them just so we could be together, the relationships just turned toxic. She got divorced just over a year ago, mine was finalized over the summer. Since then, she and her kids have moved in with me and mine. Ostensibly she has her own room in the basement, but in reality we spend most nights together, then wake and go to our respective rooms early before the kids get up. It's a mad house at times with 6 kids running through the house, but we're both happier than we have been in years.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe and I took a vacation together this summer, just the two of us. I think our family thought it was odd that a brother and sister were going a on cruise together, but I made an excuse about having purchased the non-refundable tickets before my ex and I separated and didn't want it to go to waste. Only our older sister knew what was actually going on. We spent a week vacationing, dining, socializing, and fucking as if we were husband and wife. It was the first time we'd ever been able to play those roles for more than a few hours and it was amazing. Just the simple of act of being able to put my arm around her and kiss her in public was incredible. I wish we could move someplace far away from anyone we know and start over as husband and wife but because of our family ties and the custody arrangements we have with our respective ex's, that will likely never happen.",
