That was untill 1,5 year ago when we fb each other came closer, talking 3-4 times a week. During this period we've said some naughty stuff. \n\nFor instance, she never had a guy go down on her and she's told that me that if we were ever to do something, that's the first thing she would have me do (probably because I've told her that I really like eating a woman).\n\nWe don't meet that often (7-8 times a year) but the past few times she's been teasing me, rubbing her boobs on my arm etc etc. It's not my imagination, she confessed that and also told me that she loved teasing me. But we were not alone these moments, which makes it more exciting and makes me think she really is into it.\n\nShe has also been sending me selfies (not nudes) and some are 'accidentaly' sexy. She, again, has told me that they are not 'accidentaly' sexy and she likes teasing me. A few weeks ago, she sent me a pic with her wearing her night gown and I asked her, joking, if she wanted me to come over (she was out of town, making it impossible for me to visit her). She replied something like \"No, because things will get nasty\".\u00a0 I said that nothing would happen but she replied \"how would you be able to resist with me wearing only this?\" I said that I would obviously make a move but if she told me to, I would stop. She liked that.\n\nThese are just a **few** examples of what we've said over this past year.\n\nThe thing is that next week I'll have all morning hours the house to myself. It's really a very rare thing for me and she really never has her house all by herself. So, I need to \"rush\" things and I don't know how.\n\nAll I want is to make out with her and eat her. I think sex is a bit too much, and I am totally satisfied if all I get to do is this. And I don't care if that is a one-time thing. I just want to take it out of me.\n\nHow do I proceed, being bold and telling her to come over, without blowing things up? I would be ok if she even dropped by and we just hung out, but when I'm inviting her over I would like it to be an open-for-anything invitation.\n\n",
