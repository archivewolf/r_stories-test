I'm   24 M and my cousin is 21 F. We were kind of texting and sending fun   pictures of what we did for over a year and then we started to flirt a   lot more. We kind of hinted that we liked each other on and off and this   went on for a little while. When I came home from University last year   we were at my Uncle's (her grandfather's) place for a drink and social   with our families on Christmas Eve. After I left we started messaging   and ended up telling each other that we did in fact have feelings for   one another. The next day on Christmas we had dinner and kinda sat close   to each other and wrestled with her little brother which got us time  to  touch physically. We ended up going for a drive the next night and  when  I dropped her off we kissed goodnight and it was incredible. We  hung  out again and watched a movie and made out a little bit and kind  of  moved our hands around each other but that's all that happened. She   ended up inviting me to sleep over at her grandparents place (she was   house-sitting) on New Years Eve. I eventually made my way there and we   started making out. We eventually went upstairs and had extremely   passionate and intimate sex without a condom. We then cuddled and   cradled each other all night and it felt extremely natural and   conformable. When we woke up, we proceeded to have sex again and made   breakfast together. She dropped me off at home and we had another very   intimate kiss before saying bye. I never got the chance to see her again   before I went back to school. We continued to talk for awhile and kept   making plans to maybe get a hotel somewhere between us and meet up   there. This never happened and things slowly started to end. She started   to pull away a little bit and I became a little pushy as I was craving   her. Eventually she got mad at me saying how she tried it and just   wasn't interested in that anymore. I have tried to accept this, but Ive   never felt such a strong connection to someone mentally and physically.  I  want her back but am unsure if I should even strike up conversation  and  put in work because I feel she is totally over it. What should I  do?!  :s",
