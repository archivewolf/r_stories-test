Just the usual splitting of my attention too many ways lately, including looking for a part-time job. I will continue to try posting more frequently when I am able)\n\nMonday, August 27th. I (19) woke up on my own in the guest room of my aunts' house. I felt a bit homesick as I looked at the unfamiliar ceiling and thought that my sister would have come to wake me up earlier than this, allowing us to share a private moment together. I sighed and rolled out of bed, smelling breakfast cooking and hearing music coming from the kitchen downstairs as soon as I stepped out of my room. I found Gwen and Stacy (33 and 33) in their lingerie from last night, dancing and singing along while cooking. Gwen spotted me first, a smile spreading across her face as she touched her sister's side, causing Stacy to turn and smile as well. \"Good morning!\" they both said enthusiastically. I smiled and greeted them back. Stacy told me that the food would be ready in a bit. Shortly after my arrival, a particular song on their device began playing. It's a very popular song, sung almost completely in Spanish. Yeah, that one. I don't *dislike* it, but when it first came out I heard it EVERYWHERE, so it wore on me a bit. Gwen and Stacy squealed and sang along, going back and forth each verse before pointing at me. I raised and eyebrow and shook my head. \"Sing! Sing!\" they urged me, but I told them that I don't know the words. Before I had finished the sentence, Gwen had her phone in hand and was typing rapidly, giving it to me so I could read the lyrics. I tried to sound some of the words out to myself quietly as Gwen sang the long verse, my attention being split as Stacy bounced her ass to the \"Bum bum\" parts and her sister giggled and spanked her.\n\nI don't consider myself much of a singer, and I'm not a Spanish speaker of any measure, but I did my best, giving up only after the chorus. They smiled and mouthed the words as they watched me, spending the rest of the song taking turns grinding against me. After the song was over, they spoke in Spanish for a moment before bursting with laughter. Gwen told me that her sister had noticed that I mispronounced a word, so it sounded like \"I want to breathe in your ass.\", followed by more howling laughter. I couldn't help but blush and smile bashfully as I looked at the floor. They got it out of their system and told me that I did admirably with how much time I had to prepare.\n\nWe ate breakfast together and I took the dishes to the sink. My aunts followed me. \"So, you must be wondering about last night.\" Stacy began. I admitted that it had been on my mind, but I could make a few assumptions from context clues. She told me that Gwen wants to have a baby...I can honestly say that I was NOT expecting that. My head swam for a moment. I asked her to repeat herself. She did. I asked, \"Why me?\" Stacy sighed and told me that for a few months they had been on the lookout for a good man that checked all their boxes, but Gwen wasn't satisfied with any of them so far. Then their usual groundskeeper needed surgery, which they mentioned to my mother, who suggested me. Stacy said that a light bulb went off in her head and she mentioned it to Gwen, who was hesitant, but apparently once she saw how I'd grown up she was immediately on board. Stacy continued, saying that I was young, good-looking, bright, in good shape, they knew my family's medical history AND my mother had apparently told them about the scratches she had seen on my back, so they knew that I must have some idea of what I was doing. Stacy told me that the previous morning was to test the waters to see if I was interested (Them each wearing a shirt and underwear and Stacy pressing up against me) and the encounter before bed was a \"try out\" of sorts, which I passed.\n\nIt was a lot to take in all at once, which I told them. They assured me that I shouldn't feel obligated, and that we could still be intimate, even if I didn't want to impregnate Gwen (though they added that \"accidents\" can happen) I mean...I couldn't think of many reasons NOT to do it, and I wasn't that far away, I could still be in the child's life from time to time. I agreed. They were ecstatic, both embracing me and kissing me repeatedly. I joked about still getting paid, to which they answered with more laughter, telling me that I was still doing chores for them, and that I was cheaper than in vitro. I asked when we should start, feeling a little \"amped-up\" now that I had my resolve. \"Tomorrow.\" Stacy said, adding that I probably still needed to \"recharge\" after the night before. I felt like I was up for the task that day, but I didn't want to sound vain or overeager, so I let it go. The rest of the day I checked the pool and did some cleaning around the house to feel more like I was earning my pay. My aunts would press or brush against me in passing, or we would sometimes kiss and I would feel their hand on my crotch for a moment before parting. I figured that it was a way to get my juices flowing in advance so I would be ready for Gwen the next day, which I found myself looking forward to more and more. I somehow managed to keep my hands off myself the whole day and night, tossing and turning in bed for a while before finally being able to sleep.\n\nTuesday, August 28th. It felt like I couldn't get through the day fast enough. I woke up restless and aroused, my aunts already making breakfast. I held myself back, despite wanting to grab them from behind and let my hands roam their bodies. It didn't seem like they would mind, but I couldn't be sure if this was the time or place. I ate, kissed them each and thanked them for the food before going straight to their home gym to see if I could get rid of some of this nervous energy. The weight machine eliminated my need for a spotter, so I was able to lift beyond my usual limit without worry before massacring the punching bag.  My blood thundered through my body as I wiped the sweat from my brow, taking a cool shower to ease the ache in my muscles before going back up to my room to relax. I was texting Katie and watching T.V. when Gwen slowly swung the door open fully. I practically did a double take when I saw her standing in the doorway, her arms around herself as if trying to conceal more of her body than the absolutely tiny swimsuit she was wearing. I could feel my temperature rising and my blood rushing to my loins. She smiled shyly, saying that she wanted to lounge by the pool, and that it would help if I could apply tanning oil to the hard to reach areas of her body. I eagerly agreed, replying that I would be down in a minute, figuring that I should change into my swim trunks first.\n\nOnce poolside, I approached where she was laying on a deckchair, seeing now that I was closer that her previous tan lines were noticeably larger than her current swimsuit, which I found extremely arousing (I like tan lines, especially small ones) Gwen rolled onto her stomach as I picked up the bottle of tanning oil. She asked me to undo her top. The world felt like it wobbled slightly as my genitals throbbed. I guess I was just nervous, slowly pulling on one of the strings until they came loose and I brushed them from her back. I oiled up my hands and set to work, more massaging her back, neck and shoulders than just applying it to her skin. She groaned softly and squirmed a little under my kneading hands, telling me to make sure to get every exposed surface. I swallowed before running my hands up and down her legs for a couple minutes, unable to ignore her plump, round bottom any longer than that. I really worked it over, applying more oil to my hands while rubbing and grabbing it firmly, causing her to groan louder and lift her hips from the chair she was laying on.\n\nWithout prompting, Gwen rolled onto her back, pulling her top off and dropping it on the ground next to her before laying back down. I was transfixed by her breasts. So full and tanned except for the triangle tan lines over her dark nipples. I kept my eyes on her chest even as I rubbed oil on the front of her legs, causing my hand to brush against the crotch of her bikini, Gwen jerking and letting out a quiet grunt in response. She took off her sunglasses to observe my hands running all over her sides and belly, gently taking my wrist in her hand and guiding it down her body. My heart was racing, but she stopped my hand just short of her pubic mound, closing her eyes as she breathed heavily. I noticed her lower lip trembling and asked her if something was wrong. She asked if I REALLY wanted this, or if I just saw her as a horny old lady looking to hook up with a younger guy. I have to say that I wish I could have been more comforting, but I was far too aroused, though I suppose (in a way) that my actions were the answer she was looking for. I just told her that I find her very desirable as my hand slipped into the front of her barely-there bikini, feeling her heat and moisture on my fingers making my loins ache.\n\nGwen moaned and ran her tongue over her lips, arching her body slightly as I rubbed her clitoris. I leaned in and we kissed deeply while I freed my erection from my trunks and guided her hand to it, causing her to let out a long \"Mmmmmm!\" as she stroked me. We kissed and manually pleasured each other for a couple minutes or so, getting more heated by the second before she panted, \"Fuck. I need it.\" She quickly pulled her bikini off and slid further down on the deckchair to give me easier access before she brought her legs up. I had already removed my shorts and got into position, taking a moment to admire her voluptuous figure as I placed my hands behind her knees. Gwen had turned her head to the side, her eyes closed as she reached down and spread her labia, revealing her glistening pink entrance. I eagerly and unceremoniously penetrated her, eliciting a sudden \"AhhhhUHHH!\" from my aunt as I sank into her completely.\n\nGwen's vagina was quite slick and hugged my engorged shaft firmly, which was exactly what it needed. I laid upon her, whispering my appreciation of her womanhood as I began thrusting slowly, each drawn-out stroke accompanied by a variety of noises from my aunt's lips. We had only been having sex for a few minutes before she moaned softly, \"Don't be shy. You don't need to be gentle with me.\" I wasn't aware that this was apparently a phrase that I had been waiting to hear. I grabbed her hips with both hands and began thrusting in earnest, Gwen letting out a straining grunt and her breasts bouncing each time our bodies collided. We shared a deep, hungry kiss while ramming our crotches together, Gwen panting and moaning as she lifted her legs up higher. Soon after, she cried out into my mouth as I felt her achieve climax, with my own only a minute or so after. We groaned in unison as I pressed down upon her, burying my member as deep as it could reach and keeping it there while it pulsed and squirted, Gwen groaning, \"Ohhh yes. Shoot that cum where it needs to go.\" The two of us stayed locked in this position for a few more minutes, with her reaching up to stimulate her clitoris while I felt up her breasts thoroughly, helping her to orgasm once again before we separated.\n\nWe laid together as she caught her breath, chatting with one another a little. I asked how well I had done. She said it was very satisfying, if a bit brief. I attributed that to us both being amply aroused beforehand. I kind of felt like my sister had after our first time. Inexperienced next to a more seasoned partner. Gwen smiled and said that we would make the next time last longer, or perhaps do it multiple times. We kissed and held each other a bit more before I got up and dressed, my aunt doing the same and laying back down after re-oiling herself a little. I guess her tanning WASN'T just an excuse to initiate intercourse. I felt much more at ease after I took another cool shower, though I did become aroused again when I looked from my window to admire Gwen, only to find that Stacy had returned (She had apparently went out for a bit to give us some time alone) and was kneeling next to her sister, performing oral sex on her. A shudder of lust ran through me and goosebumps raised on my skin as I thought of Stacy lapping up my semen from her sister's wet vulva. I turned from the window and decided to channel this desire into more writing. The rest of the night was uneventful, just passing the times between lunch and dinner and then dinner and bed. Stacy did congratulate me on our first \"coupling\", kissing me and thanking me again for my assistance. I replied that I was only happy to help.",

I eagerly and unceremoniously penetrated her, eliciting a sudden &amp;quot;AhhhhUHHH!&amp;quot; from my aunt as I sank into her completely.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Gwen&amp;#39;s vagina was quite slick and hugged my engorged shaft firmly, which was exactly what it needed. I laid upon her, whispering my appreciation of her womanhood as I began thrusting slowly, each drawn-out stroke accompanied by a variety of noises from my aunt&amp;#39;s lips. We had only been having sex for a few minutes before she moaned softly, &amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t be shy. You don&amp;#39;t need to be gentle with me.&amp;quot; I wasn&amp;#39;t aware that this was apparently a phrase that I had been waiting to hear. I grabbed her hips with both hands and began thrusting in earnest, Gwen letting out a straining grunt and her breasts bouncing each time our bodies collided. We shared a deep, hungry kiss while ramming our crotches together, Gwen panting and moaning as she lifted her legs up higher. Soon after, she cried out into my mouth as I felt her achieve climax, with my own only a minute or so after. We groaned in unison as I pressed down upon her, burying my member as deep as it could reach and keeping it there while it pulsed and squirted, Gwen groaning, &amp;quot;Ohhh yes. Shoot that cum where it needs to go.&amp;quot; The two of us stayed locked in this position for a few more minutes, with her reaching up to stimulate her clitoris while I felt up her breasts thoroughly, helping her to orgasm once again before we separated.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We laid together as she caught her breath, chatting with one another a little. I asked how well I had done. She said it was very satisfying, if a bit brief. I attributed that to us both being amply aroused beforehand. I kind of felt like my sister had after our first time. Inexperienced next to a more seasoned partner. Gwen smiled and said that we would make the next time last longer, or perhaps do it multiple times. We kissed and held each other a bit more before I got up and dressed, my aunt doing the same and laying back down after re-oiling herself a little. I guess her tanning WASN&amp;#39;T just an excuse to initiate intercourse. I felt much more at ease after I took another cool shower, though I did become aroused again when I looked from my window to admire Gwen, only to find that Stacy had returned (She had apparently went out for a bit to give us some time alone) and was kneeling next to her sister, performing oral sex on her. A shudder of lust ran through me and goosebumps raised on my skin as I thought of Stacy lapping up my semen from her sister&amp;#39;s wet vulva. I turned from the window and decided to channel this desire into more writing. The rest of the night was uneventful, just passing the times between lunch and dinner and then dinner and bed. Stacy did congratulate me on our first &amp;quot;coupling&amp;quot;, kissing me and thanking me again for my assistance. I replied that I was only happy to help.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
