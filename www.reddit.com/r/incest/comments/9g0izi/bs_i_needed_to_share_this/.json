Sorry in advance\\\\ for the absolute wall of text.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo for some context, and sorry if this is too much detail, but like I said my mind is going crazy right now. I'm 24 and I have five sisters and a single mother. I live at home with two of my sisters. I know I grew up with a ton of women, but I've honestly always felt more comfortable around women than men. That's probably related to being raised in this family. We've always been really close. I mean insanely close. And my family is all very touchy-feely. Especially my twin sister, my younger sister, (who this post is about) and my mother (our personalities are all very similar). In fact we've spent nights watching TV all cuddling. One night that I remember as one of the best in my life even though nothing really happened was when I was sitting right between my twin and my mom with my little sister lying with her head in my mom's lap and her legs in mine while my twin's head was on my shoulder with my arm around her. Tingles were running through my body. It was really just wholesomely close. \n\nMy younger sister and I are probably the closest though. We hold hands in public which I think my friends see as pretty weird but I just can't resist her. She's by far the best person I've ever met. She's impossibly sweet and funny and just adorable. We've actually talked before about the fact that our romantic relationships get kind of fucked up because no one treats us as well as we treat each other (I mean completely non-sexually by the way (well maybe not anymore ever since the night of her 18th birthday party but I'll get to that in a bit)). In fact we've spent a few nights sleeping in bed together (again I mean in a non-sexual way) cuddling each other because it honestly hurts a little when we're apart even when we're in the same house (and I know from conversations that she feels the same way). Our mom raised her eyebrows at us the first morning she found us in bed together and I feel like I'm being to repetitive but since this all sounds so sexual I just want to stress again that it never was that way to us. I think my twin is honestly kind of jealous of us two. She's said before that she wishes we had the same relationship that I do with Emmy (are names okay? I couldn't find anything in the rules forbidding that and I figure if she ever finds this post well then that means she was browsing the incest sub too anyway. I want to post some text conversations we've had and her name is at the top. As long as I don't post our last name I really think Emmy would be okay with it. We've posted things together on the general internet with the hashtag #emmyandjason and her usernames always have her name in them).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo her 18th birthday was two months ago and we spent it at the lake beach near our house. At some point after getting fairly drunk (which by the way is legal for her in our state because my mom gave her the drinks) we decided to leave everyone because we wanted some alone time together. We were sitting next to each other watching the waves and I semi-jokingly mentioned that if we weren't siblings this would be pretty romantic and really I was lying because it felt pretty goddamn romantic regardless. She laughed a little and put her hand on my thigh and looked me in the eyes to see if I was okay with it. I said \"oh alright, this is what we're doing then,\" and put my hand on hers. She kept watching my eyes and moved her hand up, so I did the same. We sort of played chicken then, each moving our hands up little by little. Eventually I was on her crotch and she was on mine. I was really hard and I'm sure she felt it. I started rubbing and she let it go on for ten seconds or so.  She closed her eyes and then moaned and said, \"Alright man, this is starting to get weird.\" I asked if she wanted me to stop and she said, \"I mean no, but yeah,\" so I took my hand away. She sighed and laid down and murmured to herself, and I quote, \"Your, uh, bulge I guess...it made me wet.\" We laid there for a while with my arm around her shoulders and my hand a bit on her breast. We stayed like tha for probably an hour until my twin came up to us wondering where we had gone. Emmy went back to the party and my other sister sat with me for a while. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter we went home Emmy and I were lying awake in our separate bed rooms. I think we were still buzzing on endorphins and both probably thinking over what had just happened. We had this conversation:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/oVHbsPF](https://imgur.com/a/oVHbsPF)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter that our relationship changed. We definitely seemed even closer than before. But anyways, the point of this post is that four hours ago she broke up with her boyfriend of one month. I was comforting her about it and asked what happened. She gave me the rundown of their conversation, that he was shitty to her and didn't make her feel important. I told her she was the most important thing in my life and she said she knew because that's how she feels about me. Then she said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Actually, really... it was because of you.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Wait, what?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"No, sorry, I mean...well, remember that night on the beach?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Of fucking course I do. It was really special to me.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"And me too. And honestly I can't stop thinking about it.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"I know exactly what you mean.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"And I just...I wanted that. I couldn't be with \\[ex's name\\] because I kept thinking about how he doesn't compare to you.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Emmy...oh my god. I hate that I did that to your relationship but...that just means so much to me.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd then we stared at each other for a bit. She put her hand on my face and then she kissed me. My little sister fucking kissed me and it was the most amazing moment of my life. I kissed her back for about a minute and then my other sister came home. We heard the door close and them and snapped back to reality. She started apologizing over and over again and I told her she had nothing to be sorry for. She started crying and just went to bed. My twin sister knew something was up but didn't press it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now I'm lying in my bed and I just can't stop thinking about it. I know she's emotionally vulnerable right now and I need to give her some time to deal with that, but...I really don't want to go back to how we were. At all. I am completely in love with my sister. 2000%. She's the greatest woman I know and I've never felt close to this way about anyone else in my life. And I think it's clear she wants something too. Maybe not an actual relationship like I do (honestly I would marry her if I could. I want to spend the rest of my life with her), but something. Like I said, I'll give her time to get over her boyfriend, but honestly they were only together for a month and she wasn't that attached to him. Should I escalate? I really want to, and to be honest I think I've actually already made my mind up to do so and I really just wanted to share this story with someone. Unless the response here is overwhelmingly negative, then I might rethink.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat does the community think?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",
