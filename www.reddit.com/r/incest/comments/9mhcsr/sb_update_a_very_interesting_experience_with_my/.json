                        "selftext": " \n\nSorry for the delay in posting an update. It's been an \"interesting\" last week. For anyone who hasn't already, part 1 can be found here:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/incest/comments/9l3v7w/sb\\_a\\_very\\_interesting\\_experience\\_with\\_my\\_little/](https://www.reddit.com/r/incest/comments/9l3v7w/sb_a_very_interesting_experience_with_my_little/)\n\nFor any readers particularly turned off by anecdotes that don't end in fucking, I'd rather let you know now that sadly, this one might not be for you. That is not to say that the events of the last week haven't left me with my head spinning in circles. With the disclaimers out of the way, Thursday night:\n\nAshley spent wednesday night over a one our cousins' house, who's she's relative close with. I saw her during the day, and decided that regardless of what was going to happen, I was going to be cools as a goddamn cucumber through all of it. My sis is super important to me--way more than any sexual urge. I promised myself I wouldn't be suggesting we do ANYTHING during her visit. I'd be open minded, but any boundary pushing would have to organically come from Ashley. \n\nSo Thursday night, we just got back from dinner with our parents. We drove together, and subsequently sorta started unwinding from our day. I could tell she was absolutely exhausted; as was I. I felt disgusting, so I stepped in the bathroom and took a quick 5 minute shower. I came out in my boxers and t shirt, and asked Ashley if she wanted me to mix her a drink. \n\n\"Yes please! Holy shit I need some booze in muh veins!, I'm gonna follow your lead on the whole 'not smelling like shit' trend you've seemed to started, and take a quick shower. Care if I use your body wash?\"\n\n\"Yes, you have my full permission to walk around smelling like 'Axe body wash'\", I replied. \n\n\"See, that's all I was looking for. Do me a favor and put in however much booze you think is the right amount--then add that much more booze to the drink. I'll be out in a couple minutes.\"\n\nI assumed we were going to stream something on the PS4 in my room before calling it a night. I mixed up 2 Jameson and Dr. Pepper drinks, because I'm an unsophisticated Plebeian. We were quoting Broad City on the way back from Dinner, so I cued up an episode. Ashley came out of the bathroom wearing a tanktop with no bra, and some running shorts. \n\n\"Broad City?\", I suggested before telling her there was an episode ready to go. \n\n\"Indeed\", she replied, in the likeness of Omar from \"The Wire\". \n\n\"You're hangover is on the counter, if you're still thirsty.\"\n\nWe watched a couple of episodes of Broad City and were both completely awake now. I asked Ashley what she was thinking, and she sort of returned with an expression similar to the one the other night. I just sorta chuckled, and said,\n\n\"What are ya thinking?\"\n\nShe just sat with that smart ass smirk and said, \"I've just been thinking about taboos in general, the last couple of days, just think they're so fascinating\". \n\nShe went on about the arbitrary nature of certain taboos, but mainly on the nudity aspect. \n\n\"So here's what I propose: we say fuck norms again and just hang like a couple of apes?\" she asked. \n\nI had pretty big smile, as I sorta saw it coming. \"I'm good with it\". \n\nAshley casually pulled off her tanktop and shorts. I don't think she put on panties after her shower. I followed her lead and slipped off my boxers and shirt. It felt really comforting, for some reason. I had an erection, and certainly expected to. \n\nAshley leaned over my leg to grab the controller. She put on some British procedural, that was entirely forgettable. \n\nShe sat up and looked at me, \"So, to just clear up any question, I'm not going to try and jump your bones\". \n\nI smiled and said, \"I'd assumed as much\"\n\n\"But, is it possible I could come over and cuddle for a bit?\"\n\nI nodded and sorta positioned myself so it was feasible. I laid on my back, and she laid on her side with her head on my chest/arm. She draped her leg over mine, and we half-watched, half-chatted for a bit. With the way her head was positioned, I just sorta reserved myself to the reality that my sis' face would be 5-6 inches away from my erection--for the duration of the show. \n\nAfter about 10 minutes into the show, she looked up at me with a smart ass grin and says,\n\n\"I can't see, your cock is in the way\". Before I could think of something witty, she took her hand and softly cupped my penis and held it against my stomach. Without saying a word she turned her head back to the TV. We laid in silence for the next 10 minutes. It was really calming, because she wasn't stimulating my cock, but she was being deliberately gentle with it. After a couple of minutes, she gradually repositioned her \"cupped hand\", into just softly grasping the shaft. I actually went flacid, and then hard again, all while she had a hold of me. \n\n\"Well that was interesting\", she turned and said to me, \"I've never had that happen before\".\n\nI saw her rub her index finger and thumb together, \"I think you have a little precum discharge\"\n\n\"Sorry about that,\" I said. \n\n\"No worries, I don't mind\", and she took her hand and wiped them off on her thigh. \n\nThe position was obviously starting to hurt her neck, so she slowly started to roll back onto her back and got up to go use the bathroom. When she came back, she seemed pretty tired, and said she was going to call it a night, and went to bed in the guest room.  \n\nWe had both put on some pajamas at some point in the night (or morning) and hung out for a bit, before I had to head off to work. What a night...",
