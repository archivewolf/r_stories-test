Thank you to all those who shared their advice. You helped me A LOT.\n\nRecap: I (25 y/o) moved in with my brother (31 y/o) in order to take care of him after he was severely injured in a car crash where he also lost his son. I've been his \"nurse\" for months. About 3 weeks ago we had sex, and then we both acted as if nothing had happened. I felt terrible for what we had done.\n\nI'll get onto the updates now:\n\nI talked to him honestly. I said that I feel irresponsible and ashamed, and that I think it's better to stop this.\n\nHis reply: he feels guilty too, and he was afraid that he had made me do something I didn't want to. He also admitted to having romantic feelings for me, developed during these months. (I asked him if that could be a consequence of his fragile emotional state and need for affection and he didn't rule it out)\n\nHe also asked me if I had enjoyed what we had done, and I said that I had, but this doesn't change the fact that I think it's better to stop, because 1) he's in a delicate situation and he may be not himself 2) our lives would be messed up even more.\n\nI also reassured him that my affection for him wouldn't suffer at all.\n\nThen he asked me when I had my last period; I have a delay of few days. He seemed shaken. To be honest we hadn't used protection, and I know that we were total irresponsible. Anyway, I hadn't freaked out because I am almost never regular. He seemed restless though, almost in febrile state, so I went to buy a pregnancy test to calm him down. We both were relieved since it gave a negative result.\n\nAfter this, he told me that if I had been pregnant he would have assumed his responsibility at any cost, making me know that he would have kept the child. I said that it was nice of him, but I also cringed a little: I think the trauma for the loss of his son played its part here.\n\nIn conclusion, he said that he is willing to accept and respect my decision to stop whatever we had started. He understands my reasons, though he doesn't share them. He will also take some time to think about his feelings for me, to figure out if they stem solely from his peculiar condition. Then he'll let me know and we'll deal with what to do. Meanwhile we will continue to be normal brother and sister.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you for your time, and thank you so much for all the support that you gave me. If there will be significant evolutions I'll post updates. THANK YOU!",
