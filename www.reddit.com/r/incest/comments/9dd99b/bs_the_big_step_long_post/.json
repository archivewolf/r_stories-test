The week at Gwen and Stacy's was...quite eventful, and I'm kind of...no, VERY concerned about something that happened before I returned home. I'm thinking of jumping ahead to the events of last week after this or next post before continuing with the current series of entries, considering how serious this is. Regardless, I was able to write most of this during some down time during my week of absence, finishing and editing it after I got back home and spent some time with my sister)\n\nSaturday, August 4th. Needless to say, I (19) was dead weight in the morning, having stayed up til almost 4am, but that didn't stop Mom from sending Katie (18) to awaken me. Sarah offered, but our mother just laughed and said that she wanted me downstairs within 10 minutes, not 2 hours. Sarah grinned, Jasmine shook her head, Crystal blushed and looked down at her lap (all info passed on by Katie) I tried to pull my sister on top of me, but she kept out of reach, \"Mm-mmm. You want some? You gotta get up.\" she said as she took another step back. I was reluctant and sluggish, but I rolled out of bed regardless. Once I was up, Katie took a quick look behind her, swung the door mostly closed and threw her arms around me. We kissed firmly a few times as I rubbed her arm and shoulder, my other hand cupping her taut bottom. \"You look like hell.\" she said cheerfully as we parted and she opened the door again. I let out a short laugh and told her that I was up late on my computer. \"Porn?\" she asked. I said no. \"What kind of porn?\" she said with a wide smile. I stared at her with a disgruntled look. She just kept smiling. I couldn't help but smile back and laugh it off. While I dressed, Katie watched, her arms behind her back, swaying from side to side and biting her lip. \"Mmm, you're so sexy.\" she purred softly. I smirked, took a look behind her to make sure the coast was clear and kissed her again before turning her around and giving her a gentle push, \"Let's go. I need coffee.\" I mumbled.\n\n\"He lives!\" our mother exclaimed as my sister and I rounded the corner and entered the kitchen/dining room. I smiled and shook my head. \"Long night of tossing and turning in your bed, big guy?\" Sarah asked, resting her chin on her hand. I just waved the comment away and mumbled something about being caught in a good book. After breakfast, Katie escorted her friends out while making plans to spend time together in town, rather than our house, her friends joking that she's becoming a shut-in. We lounged on the couch, watching TV as I waited for my coffee to wake me up a bit more. Mom came in and told us that she was going to go to the gym and would probably get groceries on the way back. She wrote down our food requests and told us to expect her back in 2-3 hours.\n\nI wanted to be lazy for longer, but I knew that skipping exercise is a slippery slope. I got up and stretched, telling Katie that I was going to work out. \"Can I watch?\" she asked while bouncing to her feet. I paused and cocked an eyebrow, \"Uh, yeah. Sure.\" I said before we both headed upstairs to my room. I told her that it was going to be pretty boring. \"We'll see.\" she replied, smiling and licking her teeth. I lodged my pull-up apparatus into the top of my doorway before starting to stretch, telling my sister that I was just going to be doing some pull-ups, sit-ups and push-ups. She put her hand on my torso, \"Shirt off.\" she murmured, giving me a smoldering look. I obliged, slowly pulling it up over my head and tossing it towards my hamper. Katie bit her lip while chuckling to herself, giving my abs a firm \"thud\" with her fist before running her hand over them. She spun around and flopped onto my bed, laying on her stomach with her head up, crawling to the edge to watch me.\n\nI laid down on the floor, starting with core exercises, noticing my sister rolling her hips and sighing softly. I knew she wasn't rubbing herself because both hands were in sight, so I thought that maybe she was just humping the bed. Either way, it was still arousing to me, just knowing that SHE was aroused. I switched to push ups, not able to see what she was doing as I did them, and finished with pull-ups. I was able to see that one of her hands was now under her, watching me intently with her mouth slightly agape. My shorts quickly tented, unable to control it, knowing that my sister was masturbating while staring at me. I just tried to focus on completing my exercises as quickly as possible, so that I might be able to indulge in my sexual desires before she satisfied herself. During my second set of pull-ups, I watched as her hand moved vigorously inside her shorts, her mouth opening slowly and her face contorting before she cried out. She panted and groaned afterwards as she withdrew her hand from her crotch, running her glistening fingers across her tongue. My loins throbbed and ached. I finished the set, dropped from the bar and almost pounced on her, taking a couple steps toward the bed, my erection jutting out menacingly. I stopped when I saw her body tense as if she was ready to retreat, watching me like alert prey under the gaze of a predator. I dropped to the floor and resumed, finishing the rest of my sets so quickly that I felt a little light-headed after (also possibly due to much of my blood being in my genitals)\n\nKatie was in front of me as soon as my feet hit the floor, I leaned down to kiss her, but she pulled back, keeping our lips close, but not touching. I could feel her warm breath with every pant she let out, one hand gripping the waistband of my shorts and pulling it out while the other slipped down into my boxers. I felt her slender fingers delicately running over and gently encircling my tortured manhood for a moment, quickly releasing me each time. A soft \"Ah!\" escaped my lips, followed by a short hiss between my teeth, her hand feeling oddly cool and soothing on my uncomfortably engorged member. \"Shhhh.\" she whispered, still keeping her mouth so tantalizingly close to mine, but pulling back if our lips so much as brushed together. I grew impatient, growling a little as I held her hip and quickly leaned down for a firm, drawn-out kiss. She brought her hand to my chest, \"Seth!\" she hurriedly panted, barely stopping me as our lips pressed together, but our mouths still open. \"Gently.\" she whispered as I took ragged breaths like a riled-up animal. She kissed me softly before repeating \"Gently.\" and kissing me again. So, we kissed gently, with Katie now slowly stroking my length base to tip inside my shorts with methodical twisting/gliding motions, and me, feeling myself shaking with pent-up primal urges. Good lord, she must have been studying. It was leagues ahead of her first clumsy attempt at giving me a hand job.\n\nWe kissed for a minute or two, Katie fending off my tongue with her own like an expert fencer, pulling back and only allowing the slightest bit of contact as I tried to kiss her deeply. She would occasionally release her grip on my shaft if she felt it jump or throb strongly in her hand. I think that she was trying to \"edge\" me, but I wasn't quite that close, just harder than I could ever remember being. She pulled back, now only holding me in her hand gently as she looked up at me and said softly, \"I'm going to use my mouth on you, Seth.\"(Throb) \"I'm going to wrap my lips around your long..thick..steel-hard cock, and suck it as if I was trying to draw the very life from you, until you drain your balls into my mouth.\"(Pulse) I could barely believe that this was my formerly sweet, innocent little sister saying these things to me. It sounded more like a porn star or dominatrix. She continued, \"Now, as I do this for you, I need you to do one thing for me.\"(Grunt?) She guided me to raise my hands above my head, \"Grab those.\" she nodded to the protruding handles on my chin-up bar. I did so. \"Don't let go.\" she said in a low, breathy voice, brushing and running her lips and tongue down my chest and stomach while pulling my shorts and boxers down, my erection springing up as soon as it was free. I was leaking so much pre-cum that there was a large wet spot on the inside of my underwear, with a string of it swinging from the tip of my liberated penis.\n\nKatie was quick to catch it in her mouth, smiling up at me as she sucked the thread up to my glans and nursed the tip gently, making me grunt and jump a little. She held me by the base as she ran her tongue along the side, \"Did I ever tell you...that I'm in love with your cock?\" she asked softly. I just let out a shuddering breath and thrust my hips forward a little in response. \"Mmm, it's more like I'm obsessed. Addicted. I go to bed and wake up wondering, when's the next time I'll have a taste?\" she moaned before engulfing as much of me as she possibly could, making herself gag a little before pulling me from her mouth again, not sucking as she pulled back so my shaft was left coated in her saliva, some running from her bottom lip to her chin. \"Do you think there's something wrong with me?\" she whimpered, tilting her her head to the side as she looked up with her big, shiny eyes, blinking them at me while stroking my aching member. She smiled and giggled mischievously right after, wrapping her lips around my girth again, actually applying suction this time as well as her \"twisting\" technique. Her mouth would slide down while her head was tilted one way, then tilt the other way as she sucked and pulled back, then slide down tilted the second way, pulling back and sucking while tilting the initial way again. \"Fuck!\" I blurted out. Katie smiled up at me with her mouth full, laughing slowly before going back to work on me, making the satisfied sounds of a girl that knows how well she is doing.\n\nI was surprised that I lasted more than a few minutes of this erotic torture, but all good things must come to an end. I told her how close I was, not bothering to hold back any sounds I made anymore as she went back and forth between sucking firmly and stroking while licking the tip and frenulum. She softly moaned things like, \"Come on baby. Cum for me Seth. I want it. Haven't I earned it?\" I closed my eyes, breathing heavily as I squeezed the pull-up grips, feeling the pressure build to a head right as she released me from her mouth again. I tried to warn her, but all that came out was, \"Agh! Katie!\" followed by grunts and groans through my clenched teeth. She felt the first spurt hit her upper lip before quickly enveloping me in her mouth again. I looked down to see that she too had closed her eyes, moaning as if she was having her own climax while sucking on the swollen head and stroking me into her mouth. It was a strong orgasm, yet for some reason it didn't feel quite as fulfilling as I had expected. I still felt kind of \"backed up\" afterward. Maybe I had been TOO stiff and it prevented me from releasing more. I watched as my sister stroked and squeezed any remaining semen from my shaft, tilting her head back so I could see it drip down to join the rest already in her mouth. She smiled and moaned while wiggling her tongue from side to side before closing her mouth and swallowing it all at once, wrapping her lips around me once more and sucking me clean.\n\nMy head cleared quickly enough after my climax, embracing and kissing my sister after she stood up. She asked if I liked it when she was \"bossy\". I told her I did. Honestly, I enjoy any kind of erotic activities with her. Another turn-on is being naked while she is clothed, or vise-versa. I grabbed her sexy bottom through her shorts, pulling them up her ass as much as I could slowly, my erection never going down completely and throbbing into full hardness again as I felt her buttocks becoming more exposed. She giggled and commented on the \"wedgie\" I was giving her. I just told her that it aroused me. There was more kissing and groping before I whispered that I wanted to return the favor she just gave me. Katie smiled widely up at me and bit her lip before twirling away towards the bed and jumping onto it. I walked to the foot of the bed as she removed her shorts, her underwear a little pulled down and askew. I stopped her from taking them off, telling her that I wanted to do it. She bit her lip again with a sultry look, drawing her legs up slowly before I hooked my fingers into the waistband of her \"panties\" (usually don't like that word, but it's not so bad right here) and sliding them further down. She lifted her bottom to allow me to slide them under her and off her legs, making a sound of arousal in my throat when I saw her vagina revealed. I dove down, making her let out a soft, surprised moan when my tongue quickly ran from the bottom of her labia to her clitoris. I kissed her womanhood as if it as her mouth, feeling her hips rolling while she gripped the covers with both hands, I suppose trying to hold herself to the same \"Don't let go\" rule she had imposed on me. I decided to do a similar monologue as well, telling her how much I loved her taste, her scent, how moist and slick she becomes during intimacy, the feeling of her soft, swollen vulva against my tongue and/or fingers. I groaned how much I longed to feel myself inside her and her hugging my shaft tightly.\n\nI felt her hands grab my head gently and tilt it up to look at her. She had a different look about her. A primal hunger in her eyes as her chest heaved with each quiet pant. I slid up her body. We kissed passionately. She groaned and moved her hips so I could feel her wetness on my member, groaning louder when I pressed and ground against her firmly. Our lips parted and we made eye contact. I was unsure if I should ask permission or if this was her way of consenting. She took the initiative, reaching down and holding me in her hand, stroking it a little before I felt the tip rub up and down between her labia. Her mouth fell open and she let out a sigh that was barely audible as she gently guided me into her. I guess I was a little overeager, because as soon as I felt that I was aimed properly, I decided to try and bury myself inside her with one stroke. I pushed most of the way inside of my sister before I felt some resistance. She put her hand on my abdomen and cried out, \"AaaOOH!\" I stopped and asked if she was okay. I could see her discomfort as she nodded, grimacing while her stomach tensed and relaxed. \"Go slow.\" she whispered. I decided to start moving back and forth a little, trying to slowly ease myself deeper with each forward motion, Katie letting out an \"Ahhhh\" or an \"Uhhhh\" each time I pulled back and hissing through her teeth quietly as her vaginal walls slowly yielded to my intrusion. It only took a couple minutes or so before I was buried to the hilt, holding myself there while my sister groaned and panted, dragging her nails across my back a little. We kissed again. I could feel her squeezing me at odd intervals as she made soft, breathy noises against my mouth.\n\nI started moving again, noticing that there was less resistance now, due to Katie being literally dripping wet. We got into a comfortable rhythm, now thrusting our genitals together in unison, before I let my body rest on top of hers. She moaned at different levels of volume throughout, saying near the beginning, \"Oh god. You're so big. I can feel you stretching me.\" in a wavering voice. I felt that she was a bit snug, not REALLY tight, but a good fit nonetheless. I took the liberty of letting my hands roam her exquisite body, touching her everywhere I could reach while I moved my head down to suck on her breasts. It felt as if I could do no wrong in pleasing her. I sped up or slowed down the movement of my hips, smacked her firm, round bottom, nipped her areolas, ground my pelvis against her and rubbed her anus with my fingers, all eliciting various sounds of pleasure and her nails digging into my back as it felt like she experienced orgasms (or at least strong contractions) here and there. I took it all in, looking down at my sister, her eyes closed and her mouth opened slightly as she panted and groaned. Her body writhing under me. The soft, wet sound of my penis sawing in and out of her vagina. Her warmth. Her snugness. I suddenly felt the point of no return quickly approaching and stopped, hoping to drag this out just a little longer. Katie had other plans, wrapping her legs around me and impaling herself onto me repeatedly while grunting, \"No! Don't stop! Please don't stop! Fuck me fuck me fuck me FUCK ME!\" This aroused me so much that it shattered any chance of me lasting much longer, so I gave in. I tilted her hips up, both hands on her ass while moving in and out of her like a piston, her sexual fluids spilling out and running down over my hands and her bottom. She shrieked and clawed the fuck out of my back, still rocking her hips as much as she could. She suddenly cried out, \"Yes! Seth! SEEEETH!\" before I felt her contractions, my own orgasm quickly welling up before it burst forth. I don't know what came over me (instincts maybe?) but I drove my swollen, aching prick deep into my sister's belly as soon as I felt the first stream escape.\n\nMy head was swimming as I held Katie against me as tightly as I could. Panting, grunting and swearing under my breath, my manhood throbbing and pumping away, depositing what felt like a much larger amount of semen than the previous one had been. She gasped. Startled, I looked at her face. She was looking down, her mouth hanging open. \"Oh god....you...inside?\" she said before looking up at me. I got the gist of what she was trying to say from her broken sentence, looking away guiltily as the gravity of the situation sank in a little. She wrapped her arms around my neck, pulling me down into a deep, firm kiss, her legs rubbing up and down against my sides while her hips rolled in wide circles. I could feel her rubbing her genitals against me as she moaned into my mouth. I was relieved that she wasn't upset and/or freaking out that I had ejaculated (heavily) inside of her. On the contrary, she seemed to revel in it, mewling softly as our tongues mixed together. We continued kissing and holding one another for a while, having no desire to leave the bed or even separate our crotches. After a few more minutes I did go soft enough that it made sense to pull out, my sister groaning softly in disappointment when she felt me removed from her. We laid together, kissing, touching, pressing against each other, fiddling with each other's hands, smiling and speaking softly. I felt so warm. So full in my heart. We had just made love for the first time. I asked her if it had been very painful. She said that it hurt some at first, but she had been very nervous and tense, despite her forwardness. She told me that she accidentally broke her hymen with one of our mother's toys, so she wasn't worried about it hurting like that again, but also that I had reached deeper than she had pushed the marital aid before. I was a little disappointed that I hadn't been able to deflower her fully, but only for a moment. I was still the first and only man to have entered her. She hesitantly asked if she had done well her first time. I nuzzled her and told her that she did. She then looked away shyly before asking if she had been my first. I chuckled and kissed her cheek, \"Yes.\" I replied softly. She lit up and kissed me over and over.\n\nIt had been a little over an hour since our mother had left, so we probably had at least another hour or so before her return, but I told Katie that we should clean up and be ready in advance. She agreed, as long as we showered together. I of course had no objections. As I rolled out of bed, I noticed that the sheets were damp (with sweat and sexual fluids) and the air was humid with a hint of the smell of intercourse. I opened my windows, setting up a fan to blow outward in one of them to air the room out, making a mental note to wash my bedding later and hoping that it wouldn't raise suspicion from our mother. I gathered clean clothes as I heard the shower start, quickly scurrying naked down the hall and into the bathroom, Katie smiling eagerly and waiting for me to close the door before she stepped into the shower. We embraced and kissed hungrily before I had even closed the curtain behind me. We couldn't keep our hands off each other. \"Mmm, this is so hot.\" she whispered, her hand running up the front of my body while stroking me with the other. I moaned in agreement, fondling her breasts while kneading her hip and bottom. We managed to part long enough for her to rinse off and switch places so she could soap herself up.\n\nAs soon as I was under the water, my back flared up with burning, stinging pain. I grit my teeth, grunting in surprise as I endured it until my back was just tingling. Katie jumped and asked me what was wrong. I just smiled and said that my back stung and I was caught off guard by it. She blushed while looking down at her feet and apologized. I chuckled and tilted her chin up, telling her that I liked the fact that she had to scratch me to help her deal with all the stimulation of us having sex. She failed to contain her smile before throwing herself on me and we kissed again. Between all the kissing and touching, we somehow managed to lather up. In fact I think we used a bit too much body wash, both of us being covered in thick suds as we pressed and rubbed together. \"Mmm, I'm still a little sore, but I STILL want you to fuck me again.\" she moaned while my revitalized, slippery erection was pressed between us. I laughed softly and told her that we would have plenty of time during Mom's work days. She told me that she was going to want it all the time now that she knows how good it feels. I said that I would pleasure her whenever I am able, within reason. We got clean, rinsed and dried one another. Katie inhaled through her teeth when she saw my back, \"Oooooo, fuck. I really did a number on you.\" she said as she pat my back dry.\n\nWe dressed and spent a while making out on the couch, during which Katie whispered, \"Your cum is still inside me.\" We were so involved that it didn't register at first when we heard our mother pull into the driveway, but we were able to get up, compose ourselves and be out the door before being caught. We helped carry everything in and put it away before things settled into the normal routine. Lounging, spending time on the computer, being intimate with my sister when we could get away with it. After dinner, before I got up, she came over and whispered in my ear, \"Your cum is still inside me.\" and kissed my cheek. Our mother was putting the dishes in the sink to soak, so she hadn't noticed. The three of us watched more \"Supernatural\" before bed. Mom went up first, as usual. Katie and I watched a movie together while enjoying more snuggling and kissing. I nodded off a couple times when there was a lull. After the movie was over, Katie asked if I wanted to go up to my room, smiling, biting her lip and wiggling her bottom from side to side as she was laying on top of me. I laughed a little and told her that I was fried. She pouted, but agreed to be patient and allow me to regain my stamina.\n\nWe kissed each other good night and managed to pry ourselves away from each other before going upstairs and getting ready for bed. After I brushed my teeth, my sister was outside the bathroom door to kiss me good night again. I went to my room, cursing myself for not making my bed right after I stripped the old bedding off of it earlier that day (I always wait to make it until right before bed. It's a problem) I laid down, enjoying the cool, clean sheets as I thought of our first time, and the possibilities of what was to come. I wanted to think on it more, but I was out like a light less than 2 minutes after laying down.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

The week at Gwen and Stacy&amp;#39;s was...quite eventful, and I&amp;#39;m kind of...no, VERY concerned about something that happened before I returned home. I&amp;#39;m thinking of jumping ahead to the events of last week after this or next post before continuing with the current series of entries, considering how serious this is. Regardless, I was able to write most of this during some down time during my week of absence, finishing and editing it after I got back home and spent some time with my sister)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Saturday, August 4th. Needless to say, I (19) was dead weight in the morning, having stayed up til almost 4am, but that didn&amp;#39;t stop Mom from sending Katie (18) to awaken me. Sarah offered, but our mother just laughed and said that she wanted me downstairs within 10 minutes, not 2 hours. Sarah grinned, Jasmine shook her head, Crystal blushed and looked down at her lap (all info passed on by Katie) I tried to pull my sister on top of me, but she kept out of reach, &amp;quot;Mm-mmm. You want some? You gotta get up.&amp;quot; she said as she took another step back. I was reluctant and sluggish, but I rolled out of bed regardless. Once I was up, Katie took a quick look behind her, swung the door mostly closed and threw her arms around me. We kissed firmly a few times as I rubbed her arm and shoulder, my other hand cupping her taut bottom. &amp;quot;You look like hell.&amp;quot; she said cheerfully as we parted and she opened the door again. I let out a short laugh and told her that I was up late on my computer. &amp;quot;Porn?&amp;quot; she asked. I said no. &amp;quot;What kind of porn?&amp;quot; she said with a wide smile. I stared at her with a disgruntled look. She just kept smiling. I couldn&amp;#39;t help but smile back and laugh it off. While I dressed, Katie watched, her arms behind her back, swaying from side to side and biting her lip. &amp;quot;Mmm, you&amp;#39;re so sexy.&amp;quot; she purred softly. I smirked, took a look behind her to make sure the coast was clear and kissed her again before turning her around and giving her a gentle push, &amp;quot;Let&amp;#39;s go. I need coffee.&amp;quot; I mumbled.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;He lives!&amp;quot; our mother exclaimed as my sister and I rounded the corner and entered the kitchen/dining room. I smiled and shook my head. &amp;quot;Long night of tossing and turning in your bed, big guy?&amp;quot; Sarah asked, resting her chin on her hand. I just waved the comment away and mumbled something about being caught in a good book. After breakfast, Katie escorted her friends out while making plans to spend time together in town, rather than our house, her friends joking that she&amp;#39;s becoming a shut-in. We lounged on the couch, watching TV as I waited for my coffee to wake me up a bit more. Mom came in and told us that she was going to go to the gym and would probably get groceries on the way back. She wrote down our food requests and told us to expect her back in 2-3 hours.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wanted to be lazy for longer, but I knew that skipping exercise is a slippery slope. I got up and stretched, telling Katie that I was going to work out. &amp;quot;Can I watch?&amp;quot; she asked while bouncing to her feet. I paused and cocked an eyebrow, &amp;quot;Uh, yeah. Sure.&amp;quot; I said before we both headed upstairs to my room. I told her that it was going to be pretty boring. &amp;quot;We&amp;#39;ll see.&amp;quot; she replied, smiling and licking her teeth. I lodged my pull-up apparatus into the top of my doorway before starting to stretch, telling my sister that I was just going to be doing some pull-ups, sit-ups and push-ups. She put her hand on my torso, &amp;quot;Shirt off.&amp;quot; she murmured, giving me a smoldering look. I obliged, slowly pulling it up over my head and tossing it towards my hamper. Katie bit her lip while chuckling to herself, giving my abs a firm &amp;quot;thud&amp;quot; with her fist before running her hand over them. She spun around and flopped onto my bed, laying on her stomach with her head up, crawling to the edge to watch me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I laid down on the floor, starting with core exercises, noticing my sister rolling her hips and sighing softly. I knew she wasn&amp;#39;t rubbing herself because both hands were in sight, so I thought that maybe she was just humping the bed. Either way, it was still arousing to me, just knowing that SHE was aroused. I switched to push ups, not able to see what she was doing as I did them, and finished with pull-ups. I was able to see that one of her hands was now under her, watching me intently with her mouth slightly agape. My shorts quickly tented, unable to control it, knowing that my sister was masturbating while staring at me. I just tried to focus on completing my exercises as quickly as possible, so that I might be able to indulge in my sexual desires before she satisfied herself. During my second set of pull-ups, I watched as her hand moved vigorously inside her shorts, her mouth opening slowly and her face contorting before she cried out. She panted and groaned afterwards as she withdrew her hand from her crotch, running her glistening fingers across her tongue. My loins throbbed and ached. I finished the set, dropped from the bar and almost pounced on her, taking a couple steps toward the bed, my erection jutting out menacingly. I stopped when I saw her body tense as if she was ready to retreat, watching me like alert prey under the gaze of a predator. I dropped to the floor and resumed, finishing the rest of my sets so quickly that I felt a little light-headed after (also possibly due to much of my blood being in my genitals)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Katie was in front of me as soon as my feet hit the floor, I leaned down to kiss her, but she pulled back, keeping our lips close, but not touching. I could feel her warm breath with every pant she let out, one hand gripping the waistband of my shorts and pulling it out while the other slipped down into my boxers. I felt her slender fingers delicately running over and gently encircling my tortured manhood for a moment, quickly releasing me each time. A soft &amp;quot;Ah!&amp;quot; escaped my lips, followed by a short hiss between my teeth, her hand feeling oddly cool and soothing on my uncomfortably engorged member. &amp;quot;Shhhh.&amp;quot; she whispered, still keeping her mouth so tantalizingly close to mine, but pulling back if our lips so much as brushed together. I grew impatient, growling a little as I held her hip and quickly leaned down for a firm, drawn-out kiss. She brought her hand to my chest, &amp;quot;Seth!&amp;quot; she hurriedly panted, barely stopping me as our lips pressed together, but our mouths still open. &amp;quot;Gently.&amp;quot; she whispered as I took ragged breaths like a riled-up animal. She kissed me softly before repeating &amp;quot;Gently.&amp;quot; and kissing me again. So, we kissed gently, with Katie now slowly stroking my length base to tip inside my shorts with methodical twisting/gliding motions, and me, feeling myself shaking with pent-up primal urges. Good lord, she must have been studying. It was leagues ahead of her first clumsy attempt at giving me a hand job.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We kissed for a minute or two, Katie fending off my tongue with her own like an expert fencer, pulling back and only allowing the slightest bit of contact as I tried to kiss her deeply. She would occasionally release her grip on my shaft if she felt it jump or throb strongly in her hand. I think that she was trying to &amp;quot;edge&amp;quot; me, but I wasn&amp;#39;t quite that close, just harder than I could ever remember being. She pulled back, now only holding me in her hand gently as she looked up at me and said softly, &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m going to use my mouth on you, Seth.&amp;quot;(Throb) &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m going to wrap my lips around your long..thick..steel-hard cock, and suck it as if I was trying to draw the very life from you, until you drain your balls into my mouth.&amp;quot;(Pulse) I could barely believe that this was my formerly sweet, innocent little sister saying these things to me. It sounded more like a porn star or dominatrix. She continued, &amp;quot;Now, as I do this for you, I need you to do one thing for me.&amp;quot;(Grunt?) She guided me to raise my hands above my head, &amp;quot;Grab those.&amp;quot; she nodded to the protruding handles on my chin-up bar. I did so. &amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t let go.&amp;quot; she said in a low, breathy voice, brushing and running her lips and tongue down my chest and stomach while pulling my shorts and boxers down, my erection springing up as soon as it was free. I was leaking so much pre-cum that there was a large wet spot on the inside of my underwear, with a string of it swinging from the tip of my liberated penis.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Katie was quick to catch it in her mouth, smiling up at me as she sucked the thread up to my glans and nursed the tip gently, making me grunt and jump a little. She held me by the base as she ran her tongue along the side, &amp;quot;Did I ever tell you...that I&amp;#39;m in love with your cock?&amp;quot; she asked softly. I just let out a shuddering breath and thrust my hips forward a little in response. &amp;quot;Mmm, it&amp;#39;s more like I&amp;#39;m obsessed. Addicted. I go to bed and wake up wondering, when&amp;#39;s the next time I&amp;#39;ll have a taste?&amp;quot; she moaned before engulfing as much of me as she possibly could, making herself gag a little before pulling me from her mouth again, not sucking as she pulled back so my shaft was left coated in her saliva, some running from her bottom lip to her chin. &amp;quot;Do you think there&amp;#39;s something wrong with me?&amp;quot; she whimpered, tilting her her head to the side as she looked up with her big, shiny eyes, blinking them at me while stroking my aching member. She smiled and giggled mischievously right after, wrapping her lips around my girth again, actually applying suction this time as well as her &amp;quot;twisting&amp;quot; technique. Her mouth would slide down while her head was tilted one way, then tilt the other way as she sucked and pulled back, then slide down tilted the second way, pulling back and sucking while tilting the initial way again. &amp;quot;Fuck!&amp;quot; I blurted out. Katie smiled up at me with her mouth full, laughing slowly before going back to work on me, making the satisfied sounds of a girl that knows how well she is doing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was surprised that I lasted more than a few minutes of this erotic torture, but all good things must come to an end. I told her how close I was, not bothering to hold back any sounds I made anymore as she went back and forth between sucking firmly and stroking while licking the tip and frenulum. She softly moaned things like, &amp;quot;Come on baby. Cum for me Seth. I want it. Haven&amp;#39;t I earned it?&amp;quot; I closed my eyes, breathing heavily as I squeezed the pull-up grips, feeling the pressure build to a head right as she released me from her mouth again. I tried to warn her, but all that came out was, &amp;quot;Agh! Katie!&amp;quot; followed by grunts and groans through my clenched teeth. She felt the first spurt hit her upper lip before quickly enveloping me in her mouth again. I looked down to see that she too had closed her eyes, moaning as if she was having her own climax while sucking on the swollen head and stroking me into her mouth. It was a strong orgasm, yet for some reason it didn&amp;#39;t feel quite as fulfilling as I had expected. I still felt kind of &amp;quot;backed up&amp;quot; afterward. Maybe I had been TOO stiff and it prevented me from releasing more. I watched as my sister stroked and squeezed any remaining semen from my shaft, tilting her head back so I could see it drip down to join the rest already in her mouth. She smiled and moaned while wiggling her tongue from side to side before closing her mouth and swallowing it all at once, wrapping her lips around me once more and sucking me clean.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My head cleared quickly enough after my climax, embracing and kissing my sister after she stood up. She asked if I liked it when she was &amp;quot;bossy&amp;quot;. I told her I did. Honestly, I enjoy any kind of erotic activities with her. Another turn-on is being naked while she is clothed, or vise-versa. I grabbed her sexy bottom through her shorts, pulling them up her ass as much as I could slowly, my erection never going down completely and throbbing into full hardness again as I felt her buttocks becoming more exposed. She giggled and commented on the &amp;quot;wedgie&amp;quot; I was giving her. I just told her that it aroused me. There was more kissing and groping before I whispered that I wanted to return the favor she just gave me. Katie smiled widely up at me and bit her lip before twirling away towards the bed and jumping onto it. I walked to the foot of the bed as she removed her shorts, her underwear a little pulled down and askew. I stopped her from taking them off, telling her that I wanted to do it. She bit her lip again with a sultry look, drawing her legs up slowly before I hooked my fingers into the waistband of her &amp;quot;panties&amp;quot; (usually don&amp;#39;t like that word, but it&amp;#39;s not so bad right here) and sliding them further down. She lifted her bottom to allow me to slide them under her and off her legs, making a sound of arousal in my throat when I saw her vagina revealed. I dove down, making her let out a soft, surprised moan when my tongue quickly ran from the bottom of her labia to her clitoris. I kissed her womanhood as if it as her mouth, feeling her hips rolling while she gripped the covers with both hands, I suppose trying to hold herself to the same &amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t let go&amp;quot; rule she had imposed on me. I decided to do a similar monologue as well, telling her how much I loved her taste, her scent, how moist and slick she becomes during intimacy, the feeling of her soft, swollen vulva against my tongue and/or fingers. I groaned how much I longed to feel myself inside her and her hugging my shaft tightly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I felt her hands grab my head gently and tilt it up to look at her. She had a different look about her. A primal hunger in her eyes as her chest heaved with each quiet pant. I slid up her body. We kissed passionately. She groaned and moved her hips so I could feel her wetness on my member, groaning louder when I pressed and ground against her firmly. Our lips parted and we made eye contact. I was unsure if I should ask permission or if this was her way of consenting. She took the initiative, reaching down and holding me in her hand, stroking it a little before I felt the tip rub up and down between her labia. Her mouth fell open and she let out a sigh that was barely audible as she gently guided me into her. I guess I was a little overeager, because as soon as I felt that I was aimed properly, I decided to try and bury myself inside her with one stroke. I pushed most of the way inside of my sister before I felt some resistance. She put her hand on my abdomen and cried out, &amp;quot;AaaOOH!&amp;quot; I stopped and asked if she was okay. I could see her discomfort as she nodded, grimacing while her stomach tensed and relaxed. &amp;quot;Go slow.&amp;quot; she whispered. I decided to start moving back and forth a little, trying to slowly ease myself deeper with each forward motion, Katie letting out an &amp;quot;Ahhhh&amp;quot; or an &amp;quot;Uhhhh&amp;quot; each time I pulled back and hissing through her teeth quietly as her vaginal walls slowly yielded to my intrusion. It only took a couple minutes or so before I was buried to the hilt, holding myself there while my sister groaned and panted, dragging her nails across my back a little. We kissed again. I could feel her squeezing me at odd intervals as she made soft, breathy noises against my mouth.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I started moving again, noticing that there was less resistance now, due to Katie being literally dripping wet. We got into a comfortable rhythm, now thrusting our genitals together in unison, before I let my body rest on top of hers. She moaned at different levels of volume throughout, saying near the beginning, &amp;quot;Oh god. You&amp;#39;re so big. I can feel you stretching me.&amp;quot; in a wavering voice. I felt that she was a bit snug, not REALLY tight, but a good fit nonetheless. I took the liberty of letting my hands roam her exquisite body, touching her everywhere I could reach while I moved my head down to suck on her breasts. It felt as if I could do no wrong in pleasing her. I sped up or slowed down the movement of my hips, smacked her firm, round bottom, nipped her areolas, ground my pelvis against her and rubbed her anus with my fingers, all eliciting various sounds of pleasure and her nails digging into my back as it felt like she experienced orgasms (or at least strong contractions) here and there. I took it all in, looking down at my sister, her eyes closed and her mouth opened slightly as she panted and groaned. Her body writhing under me. The soft, wet sound of my penis sawing in and out of her vagina. Her warmth. Her snugness. I suddenly felt the point of no return quickly approaching and stopped, hoping to drag this out just a little longer. Katie had other plans, wrapping her legs around me and impaling herself onto me repeatedly while grunting, &amp;quot;No! Don&amp;#39;t stop! Please don&amp;#39;t stop! Fuck me fuck me fuck me FUCK ME!&amp;quot; This aroused me so much that it shattered any chance of me lasting much longer, so I gave in. I tilted her hips up, both hands on her ass while moving in and out of her like a piston, her sexual fluids spilling out and running down over my hands and her bottom. She shrieked and clawed the fuck out of my back, still rocking her hips as much as she could. She suddenly cried out, &amp;quot;Yes! Seth! SEEEETH!&amp;quot; before I felt her contractions, my own orgasm quickly welling up before it burst forth. I don&amp;#39;t know what came over me (instincts maybe?) but I drove my swollen, aching prick deep into my sister&amp;#39;s belly as soon as I felt the first stream escape.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My head was swimming as I held Katie against me as tightly as I could. Panting, grunting and swearing under my breath, my manhood throbbing and pumping away, depositing what felt like a much larger amount of semen than the previous one had been. She gasped. Startled, I looked at her face. She was looking down, her mouth hanging open. &amp;quot;Oh god....you...inside?&amp;quot; she said before looking up at me. I got the gist of what she was trying to say from her broken sentence, looking away guiltily as the gravity of the situation sank in a little. She wrapped her arms around my neck, pulling me down into a deep, firm kiss, her legs rubbing up and down against my sides while her hips rolled in wide circles. I could feel her rubbing her genitals against me as she moaned into my mouth. I was relieved that she wasn&amp;#39;t upset and/or freaking out that I had ejaculated (heavily) inside of her. On the contrary, she seemed to revel in it, mewling softly as our tongues mixed together. We continued kissing and holding one another for a while, having no desire to leave the bed or even separate our crotches. After a few more minutes I did go soft enough that it made sense to pull out, my sister groaning softly in disappointment when she felt me removed from her. We laid together, kissing, touching, pressing against each other, fiddling with each other&amp;#39;s hands, smiling and speaking softly. I felt so warm. So full in my heart. We had just made love for the first time. I asked her if it had been very painful. She said that it hurt some at first, but she had been very nervous and tense, despite her forwardness. She told me that she accidentally broke her hymen with one of our mother&amp;#39;s toys, so she wasn&amp;#39;t worried about it hurting like that again, but also that I had reached deeper than she had pushed the marital aid before. I was a little disappointed that I hadn&amp;#39;t been able to deflower her fully, but only for a moment. I was still the first and only man to have entered her. She hesitantly asked if she had done well her first time. I nuzzled her and told her that she did. She then looked away shyly before asking if she had been my first. I chuckled and kissed her cheek, &amp;quot;Yes.&amp;quot; I replied softly. She lit up and kissed me over and over.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It had been a little over an hour since our mother had left, so we probably had at least another hour or so before her return, but I told Katie that we should clean up and be ready in advance. She agreed, as long as we showered together. I of course had no objections. As I rolled out of bed, I noticed that the sheets were damp (with sweat and sexual fluids) and the air was humid with a hint of the smell of intercourse. I opened my windows, setting up a fan to blow outward in one of them to air the room out, making a mental note to wash my bedding later and hoping that it wouldn&amp;#39;t raise suspicion from our mother. I gathered clean clothes as I heard the shower start, quickly scurrying naked down the hall and into the bathroom, Katie smiling eagerly and waiting for me to close the door before she stepped into the shower. We embraced and kissed hungrily before I had even closed the curtain behind me. We couldn&amp;#39;t keep our hands off each other. &amp;quot;Mmm, this is so hot.&amp;quot; she whispered, her hand running up the front of my body while stroking me with the other. I moaned in agreement, fondling her breasts while kneading her hip and bottom. We managed to part long enough for her to rinse off and switch places so she could soap herself up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As soon as I was under the water, my back flared up with burning, stinging pain. I grit my teeth, grunting in surprise as I endured it until my back was just tingling. Katie jumped and asked me what was wrong. I just smiled and said that my back stung and I was caught off guard by it. She blushed while looking down at her feet and apologized. I chuckled and tilted her chin up, telling her that I liked the fact that she had to scratch me to help her deal with all the stimulation of us having sex. She failed to contain her smile before throwing herself on me and we kissed again. Between all the kissing and touching, we somehow managed to lather up. In fact I think we used a bit too much body wash, both of us being covered in thick suds as we pressed and rubbed together. &amp;quot;Mmm, I&amp;#39;m still a little sore, but I STILL want you to fuck me again.&amp;quot; she moaned while my revitalized, slippery erection was pressed between us. I laughed softly and told her that we would have plenty of time during Mom&amp;#39;s work days. She told me that she was going to want it all the time now that she knows how good it feels. I said that I would pleasure her whenever I am able, within reason. We got clean, rinsed and dried one another. Katie inhaled through her teeth when she saw my back, &amp;quot;Oooooo, fuck. I really did a number on you.&amp;quot; she said as she pat my back dry.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We dressed and spent a while making out on the couch, during which Katie whispered, &amp;quot;Your cum is still inside me.&amp;quot; We were so involved that it didn&amp;#39;t register at first when we heard our mother pull into the driveway, but we were able to get up, compose ourselves and be out the door before being caught. We helped carry everything in and put it away before things settled into the normal routine. Lounging, spending time on the computer, being intimate with my sister when we could get away with it. After dinner, before I got up, she came over and whispered in my ear, &amp;quot;Your cum is still inside me.&amp;quot; and kissed my cheek. Our mother was putting the dishes in the sink to soak, so she hadn&amp;#39;t noticed. The three of us watched more &amp;quot;Supernatural&amp;quot; before bed. Mom went up first, as usual. Katie and I watched a movie together while enjoying more snuggling and kissing. I nodded off a couple times when there was a lull. After the movie was over, Katie asked if I wanted to go up to my room, smiling, biting her lip and wiggling her bottom from side to side as she was laying on top of me. I laughed a little and told her that I was fried. She pouted, but agreed to be patient and allow me to regain my stamina.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We kissed each other good night and managed to pry ourselves away from each other before going upstairs and getting ready for bed. After I brushed my teeth, my sister was outside the bathroom door to kiss me good night again. I went to my room, cursing myself for not making my bed right after I stripped the old bedding off of it earlier that day (I always wait to make it until right before bed. It&amp;#39;s a problem) I laid down, enjoying the cool, clean sheets as I thought of our first time, and the possibilities of what was to come. I wanted to think on it more, but I was out like a light less than 2 minutes after laying down.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
