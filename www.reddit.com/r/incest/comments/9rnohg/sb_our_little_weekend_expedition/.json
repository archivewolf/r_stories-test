It isn\u2019t as simple as you guys make it seem. Sure if I want to be exiled from my family and friends, shunned from my community then yeah I guess I can marry my brother.\n\nNone of this means I wouldn\u2019t want to, it just means there\u2019s so much to lose if I did. We make the most out of any time spent with one another and I know cheating on my fianc\u00e9 is wrong, but I\u2019ve been with my brother for 10 years now.\n\nAnyway, last weekend I went to do fall stuff with my brother and his child. It was fun, that evening his child went with the mother. Me and my boyfriend decided to get some drinks and food. I couldn\u2019t stay the night, there was no rational excuse but it was so hard to leave. The next morning when my fianc\u00e9 went to go golf with his family I went to my brothers for a few hours. \n\nIt\u2019s been a few weeks since I got to spend more than an hour alone with him so it was so nice. We actually got to take our time instead of having to rush. Being with him is what I look most forward to. I told him how I\u2019ve been posting here and he seemed a little concerned. After explaining to him how discreet I am I think he finally accepted that I needed this outlet.\n\nLast Sunday was beyond magical, getting to enjoy each other in ways we can\u2019t when we only have such short time. I do feel somewhat guilty that the things me and my brother share I can\u2019t with my fianc\u00e9. When we\u2019re together I feel as if we are one. Making love is truly an out of body experience, the way we look at each other can\u2019t even be explained justly. \n\nNo man has ever given me the orgasms my brother can, when he goes down on me it feels as if my body loses all control. I love him more than anything. I love making love to him more than anyone. \n\nAll week I\u2019ve been craving him more and more, our texts get longer and longer. They get more detailed and in depth, I even sent him a few pictures throughout the week which I never do to my fianc\u00e9. Trying to make plans for this weekend has been so tough. I\u2019m hoping tomorrow we find a way, if not he took off Monday and I plan on leaving early to go see him. \n\nI can\u2019t understand why this has to be so hard, I\u2019ll keep you guys posted on what happens this weekend. I also see one or two people asked about a cruise we took a few years back. If you want me to post or anything about it feel free to let me know. I said I\u2019d stay more recent and current but if there\u2019s anything you want to know feel free to ask.",
