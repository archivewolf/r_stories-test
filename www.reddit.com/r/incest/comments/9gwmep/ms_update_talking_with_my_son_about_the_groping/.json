I will just give the general gist of what happened after that post.\n\nThe first post\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/incest/comments/9gctys/ms_son_groped_me_while_i_was_sleeping\n\n\nAfter listening to some of your guys comments and with help from a few guys pming me i decided to confront him.\n\nSo in the evening when my husband was out, i went to his room and started to talk to him without giving him an out.\n\nI started by first explaining why consent was very important. And how he should not do this to anyone else. I think he understood that after i spent half an hour explaining it. \n\nAfter that came the talk of why he did it. A few of you guys have been asking me whether he has had girlfriends, since he could be just taking out his lust on the nearest target. \n\nWell turns out, he was really interested in me, and not just as an outlet for him. I was flattered and asked him whether he had done something like this before with me. That is when he showed the photos of him rubbing his cock on my face as i slept. That really shocked me and i demanded that he delete these pics and videos, and to not take any more pics or videos like that again.\n\nIn exchange i told him that he was allowed to touch my body with permission and only when i am awake. And also only with his hands.\n\nI couldn't stop him after that. Since that talk he has been very touchy with me whenever possible. And sometimes even when my husband is in the room. Though he would make sure my husband doesn't know about it.\n\nThis is all i can say for now. Maybe i will give more details in my next post.",

Let him explore your body and show you affection. Let him give you pleasure.  It would be really amazing if you reciprocate and stimulate him as well. Maybe it would be easier to start out just masturbating together. It\u2019s not bad at all. I have nothing but positive memories from when my mom let me touch her breasts while she stroked me. It brought us extremely close. It was beautiful. My only regret is that I didn\u2019t give her the same pleasure she gave me. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
