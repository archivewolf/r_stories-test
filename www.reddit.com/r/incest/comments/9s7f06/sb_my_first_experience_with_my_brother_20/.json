I thought I'd let you in on a few more firsts.\n\nLike I mentioned in my last post ( found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/incest/comments/9rx3q0/sb_my_first_experience_with_my_brother/)), my brother had been very distant and weird (because of his attraction to me).  After that night, it changed completely. At first I was very apprehensive. I spent a lot of time getting to terms with what had happened. I thought what we had done was wrong, and that I was gross and wrong in liking my own brother. We talked a lot about it, and in the end he helped me see that there was nothing wrong in loving someone (or wanting for that matter). Our friendship evolved immensely. We trust each other more than anyone else, and we've even gone back to playing games and hanging out together. It's been amazing, and I wouldn't change a thing.\n\nSo to other firsts.\n\nMy brother loves oral. I have never been a fan of having people go down on me, but I love sucking dick. This resulted in a lot of me going down on him the first few months, and him never going down on me. I just never gave him the opportunity. It's not like it was a big deal? But I just felt awkward and self conscious about it. Either way I loved blowjobs a lot more, and it got me off way more than him going down on me would. Or so I thought lol\u2026\n\nAfter about a hundred blowjobs and a lot of amazing sex over the course of about 3 months, he asked me (while we were cuddling in bed) what the deal was. He didn't really want to push it, but he was curious why I had always \"changed the subject\" when he tried to go down on me. I told him it wasn't really my thing, and that in the past I never really liked it. He asked if he could try anyway, and I kinda (but not very) reluctantly agreed.\n\nI was lying on my back in his bed, and he sat up over me, and started kissing my neck. He softly kissed me down towards my collarbone, and then further down to my breasts. He really took his time, and ran his tongue over my nipples the way he knew made me crazy with lust. Then he moved further down and kissed my stomach all the way down to my thighs. I thought he was going to start around my lips at this point, but again he really took his time. Kissing and softly biting my thighs in a way that made me want him even more than when he had been playing with my tits. I didn't expect it, but I felt my hips starting to move, and I started grinding towards him from wanting him so badly - I didn't know I could be this turned on!\n\nAfter teasing me like this for what seemed like an eternity ( I mean come ooooon please just let me have you!), he finally moved in. He let his tongue dance around my clit while he gently started fucking me with his fingers. I was so wet I swear it was probably dripping. I couldn't think straight, it was just so damn nice. I think it was probably only a minute before I came, and I was shaking like crazy. He knew exactly what he was doing, and the orgasm was probably one of my top ten. After, he lay down beside me, looking quite pleased with himself. I started laughing, and he laughed with me.\n\n\"Was it that bad?\" he asked through his grin.\n\n\"Bad? That was horrible!\" I exclaimed sarcastically.\n\n\"Judging by the need for new bedsheets, I think I might have to disagree\" he laughed.\n\nI looked at him for a second, before I pulled him in for a kiss, and let him do it all over again.\n\nUp until this point I thought I just wasn't a fan of receiving. Safe to say he proved me wrong - both on this subject and on a few others that I thought I'd tell you about later. He really opened up a whole new world for me. The best part is, I got my best friend back - and our relationship is just better than ever before.\n\nI did want to ask you guys though.. Why do you think so many people enjoy this whole thing? Relationships with relatives shouldn't really be encouraged from a reproductive point of view I guess? I'm obviously ok with everything now, but I still catch myself questioning why I feel so strongly for him. I think I just love the way my big brother makes me feel so safe and vulnerable at the same time? Idk\u2026",

                        "body": "Honestly reproductive problems happen with every one, it's just a genetic problem that anyone could match up similar or have odd structures.  I've read related couples get the female checked and I think just in simple testing can tell if you would have similar problems as if any child birth as family history can have effects. They have a heap of media and research that is based on terrible examples but as we all know the truth is always covered up with ten tons of shit to confuse most people. Not everyone family is born with the feelings of a romantic kind, I read that two types exist, basically the one you are born with and one that mostly common is basically when you get distance between each other. At times this had applied to adoptions that meet a family member and fall in love with a strong bond as it is common, the mental and physical connection most could only dream of. \n\nI have hardly read any stories that don't have the siblings get an idea they should move on with what old people in dresses and suits claim a normal relationship of exchanging of written names on some registry stuffed away in some dusty storage. But either they both live with a hole missing which normally causes divorce in the stories I've read. Honestly I'm unsure when they started forcing this taboo idea heavily onto people. It isn't like if it was legal and no one cared, it would make near to any difference. I have been reading some more younger couples realizing the connection between them and sound just happy being together. It isn't like anyone except 14yrs make out in public with there hands up each other.\n\nA lot of the time the distance between each other forms a new picture of one and other and can cause this kind of reaction. To hate yourself or think it is wrong or you can't make a life out of it are your own ideas. If someone started doing false reports or exaggerated reports enough to convince most people that it's ok to kill yourself and you should feel nothing for the people that do it or the people you leave behind. I wonder what would happen, just an idea. Most would turn and say but God doesn't allow suicides in. \n\nFamily are people that form titles and roles in society. If you remove those titles, strip them of clothes you will see they are nothing but a person. In your case a person you love as the social title brother and as a romantic partner you share a deep bond with. I know that adoptions back before they were allowed to know birth parents, have ended up by chance falling deeply in love and married each other, one story went public. But imagining the heaps that may have never found the truth or cared to look, and ended up married. It is just a form of control you must remember at all times nearly everyone is a slave. They made it so slaves have an ability to live more comfortable but work 80%or more of the year to enjoy the such things they buy just to never really own it. \n\nSo the answer is you feel the way you do because your eyes opened once you realized he liked you more than just a friend or family. While he may have felt confused about and resolved to not bother you with it out of respect. He also couldn't lie too you regardless, causing you to realize you both are people. Not every person gets that kind of bond. If it wasn't for peoples reactions on the issue life would be normal. But moving some distance and living as married couples do. Pretending around the people you don't want to bother. \n\nPeople never make a fuse about the food they eat until you tell them the ingredients ",

                        "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Honestly reproductive problems happen with every one, it&amp;#39;s just a genetic problem that anyone could match up similar or have odd structures.  I&amp;#39;ve read related couples get the female checked and I think just in simple testing can tell if you would have similar problems as if any child birth as family history can have effects. They have a heap of media and research that is based on terrible examples but as we all know the truth is always covered up with ten tons of shit to confuse most people. Not everyone family is born with the feelings of a romantic kind, I read that two types exist, basically the one you are born with and one that mostly common is basically when you get distance between each other. At times this had applied to adoptions that meet a family member and fall in love with a strong bond as it is common, the mental and physical connection most could only dream of. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have hardly read any stories that don&amp;#39;t have the siblings get an idea they should move on with what old people in dresses and suits claim a normal relationship of exchanging of written names on some registry stuffed away in some dusty storage. But either they both live with a hole missing which normally causes divorce in the stories I&amp;#39;ve read. Honestly I&amp;#39;m unsure when they started forcing this taboo idea heavily onto people. It isn&amp;#39;t like if it was legal and no one cared, it would make near to any difference. I have been reading some more younger couples realizing the connection between them and sound just happy being together. It isn&amp;#39;t like anyone except 14yrs make out in public with there hands up each other.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A lot of the time the distance between each other forms a new picture of one and other and can cause this kind of reaction. To hate yourself or think it is wrong or you can&amp;#39;t make a life out of it are your own ideas. If someone started doing false reports or exaggerated reports enough to convince most people that it&amp;#39;s ok to kill yourself and you should feel nothing for the people that do it or the people you leave behind. I wonder what would happen, just an idea. Most would turn and say but God doesn&amp;#39;t allow suicides in. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Family are people that form titles and roles in society. If you remove those titles, strip them of clothes you will see they are nothing but a person. In your case a person you love as the social title brother and as a romantic partner you share a deep bond with. I know that adoptions back before they were allowed to know birth parents, have ended up by chance falling deeply in love and married each other, one story went public. But imagining the heaps that may have never found the truth or cared to look, and ended up married. It is just a form of control you must remember at all times nearly everyone is a slave. They made it so slaves have an ability to live more comfortable but work 80%or more of the year to enjoy the such things they buy just to never really own it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So the answer is you feel the way you do because your eyes opened once you realized he liked you more than just a friend or family. While he may have felt confused about and resolved to not bother you with it out of respect. He also couldn&amp;#39;t lie too you regardless, causing you to realize you both are people. Not every person gets that kind of bond. If it wasn&amp;#39;t for peoples reactions on the issue life would be normal. But moving some distance and living as married couples do. Pretending around the people you don&amp;#39;t want to bother. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;People never make a fuse about the food they eat until you tell them the ingredients &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
