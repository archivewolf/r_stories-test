I've never wanted to talk about it until now so, here goes. For privacy reasons I am changing the names and ages of my brother and I.\n\nMy family has always been... crazy, to say the least. Growing up both of my parents struggled with alcoholism and drug addiction, they separated when I was very young. I have some memories of a time when it was all of us for but for the most part it had always been me, my older brother Steven and my mom. My brother Steven has severe mental illness and because of that I was always very scared of him and never truly felt a connection to him. It was like that with most of my family. My little sister was born when I was 9 and my little brother came when I had just turned 10. Around this time we were making a big move to a new town, I won't explain a lot of the details of this move but I had never imagined the things that would happen, I had never even given thought to it.\n\nAs a child I was raised around a large family, I had always been very curious and the most \"incestual\" experience I had ever had was \"I'll show you mine if you show me yours\" with my cousins. My best friend and I would sometimes rub ourselves together but like I said, I had always been very curious and extremely smart. I was very aware of my sexuality from a very young age. When we moved into this new house, my brother had joined the military and my uncle had moved in with us to help my mom take care of the kids. My uncle was close with my father growing up and on his side I have 2 other sisters and another older brother. We'll call him Paul. Paul and I had known each other up until I was 6 and he was 7, I believe. With my uncle moving in we received a lot of new knowledge about Paul and his whereabouts. My mom invited Paul to come live with us because he was struggling without his mother there and with our father being the king of abandonment, I can imagine it was a scary time for him. We were older now, I was 17 and he was 18.\n\nThe first thing I had noticed about him is how much he grew up. He was no longer this squeaky, annoying brother of mine - he was built and rather good-looking especially compared to the boys and men that live in my area, ha! I don't know what it was but when he hugged me, I felt so safe in his arms. I knew that he would never do something to hurt me. I knew that he loved me. To be completely honest, the both of us did grow up with some major issues with drugs but at the time, I was still just beginning. We smoked pot together a few times, he never pushed or pressured me like other guys did. He wanted to be in my company and something about that made me feel so special with him.\n\nI had a lot of older girl friends and at one point I had found out that one of my friends had given him a blowjob - I remember this jealousy that boiled up inside of me. I made up cruel lies about her and acted out and genuinely, I was just terrible to her and I truly regret my actions towards her. This was the first time I had ever admitted to myself that I was attracted to him. Flash forward a bit; the two of us and a friend of ours had been hanging out and gotten coke to split up together. I was really excited because it was my second time doing it and my brother was there - something about that made me feel so bubbly and warm.\n\nMy mom worked nights so she slept a lot during the day and my younger siblings were always at the babysitters because by this point in time my uncle had moved out. I think she didn't trust Paul around the kids because of his drug use and she hadn't yet discovered that I was also using drugs. (I want to be very clear that my brother had nothing to do with my starting of drugs, it was friends that had originally introduced them to me) Paul, our friend and I had been sitting in the living room watching this ridiculous hentai series that we had all enjoyed laughing at and making fun of. Looking back it at all of us were probably into the sex scenes and too embarrassed to actually talk about it.\n\nIt was coming time for our friend to leave, Paul and I each said our goodbyes and as he was leaving I turned to go to the bathroom. When I came back out, Paul was sitting in the living room chair jerking off. He must think I went back to my bedroom, I thought. I stood there for a moment watching him, seeing him in this light I had always noticed but never wanted to admit that I had seen. He was beautiful. His shirt was off and aside from a little patch of fur, his skin looked so soft. It was really odd from other men I had seen in this way. They always looked so rough and mean but his body curved with this ease, I was entranced. I don't know how long I stood there watching his hands move all over his body and touching his cock. Even there, he looked so gentle. He was the biggest I had ever seen up to that point and still to this day I have only ever seen 2 that were bigger than his. \n\nThe floor beneath me creaked and he quickly pulled his shorts up, noticing that I was standing there. He asked me what I was doing and I told him I was just leaving the bathroom. He asked me if I had seen anything and my body went cold.\n\n\"What do I say? Do I tell him the truth?\nWill I lose him if I do?\"\n\nI told him no and asked if we could finish the episode together. This was something we hadn't done before. With our friend there, I don't think that either of us saw it as weird but now, we were together and it was just us. \n\nAnd I had just watched him throbbing in his hands.\n\nHe said yes and instead of sitting on the couch, I chose to sit on the floor next to the chair he was sitting in. I rested my head against his thigh and sat there in confusion as to what I had just felt rising in me. If took me a while to muster up the courage but  finally, I tilted my head to a normal position and I told him that I lied and that I had seen him touching himself. At the time, I was really quite innocent about things, I didn't know a lot of the terminology that I know now. I mean, I didn't even know that this was incest. I had no idea what the word even meant. He told me he was sorry that he was so open about it and I asked him if it was wrong that I liked it.\n\nIt was this moment that everything changed. I looked up at him and he looked down at me and I saw something different him. Something raw and real. He asked me if I wanted to see it again.\n\nI said yes. I think I would've begged at that point. I could already see that he was still hard underneath his shorts and up close, it looked even bigger. He pulled it out and it instantly jerked upwards, it was the sexiest thing I have ever seen with a man. It went just half an inch or so above his belly button and it was thick. He took it in his hands and he asked me what I thought. I told him that I knew it wasn't okay but that I wanted to put it in my mouth. He put his fingers on my chin gently and looked down at me and said \"nothing that we feel is wrong.\" I looked up into his eyes and than took him in my hand, it felt like the most natural thing in the world.\n\nI can't tell you how long I licked him up and down, how deep I took him into me - all I can remember is the fire that burned so hot inside of me. His moans only encouraged me more. I wanted to have him. I wanted to make him all mine and keep him forever, I wanted us to stay like this. When we both heard a noise from my moms bedroom we stopped. We both stood up and he told me to go in the bathroom and start a shower so I did. I made it hot, hot as I could stand. He had awakened something in me that I didn't know existed. I wasn't sure if he was going to come back but shortly after I had jumped in, he was there. He pulled the shower curtain open and told me to get out, my vulnerability bare and open for him. He took me in his arms and pulled me in, he kissed my forehead and with one swift motion picked me up and set me on the bathroom sink. He asked me if I wanted this. All I could do was nod furiously.\n\nI was dripping wet and he was so hard, when he first put it inside me I couldn't contain the moan that escaped my lips. He looked down at me and quietly said \"Shhhh, baby.\" That was a phrase he would come to use often but I really couldn't help it. He fit so perfectly inside of me, I could feel myself squeezing around him, his cock pulsated inside me. He was so deep that I came almost instantly, for the first time ever. Literally ever. And at this point I had sex with 3 other people, I had never gotten off until this moment and oh my God, I wanted to feel that good every day. He kept thrusting, truly lasting longer than I thought he would because of my experiences with other guys. I had started squirting and I think because of our inexperience it scared him because he quickly pulled out. I told him I didn't know what that was and he said he didn't either and than I asked him to put it back. I was probably more demanding than I make it sound. He rubbed the tip against my clit and it was like nothing I had ever felt, he was so good at this. He put it back inside me and I wrapped my arms around his neck and he kept thrusting in and out of me. I came again and right after I heard him let out a deep moan and in that moment realized that was about to cum inside me. I quickly pushed him away and it got all over my, er, lady parts. Still to this day, I'm sure that he came inside me and what came out was just the after shock. After this we could hardly keep our hands off of each other.\n\nAnd than my brother Steven came home on a dishonorable discharge from the military. And than my mom shipped Paul away to another state.\n\nIt's been a long, long time since that period of my life. I recently got in touch him and will be hearing his voice for the first time in years. A lot has happened since than and I have never once held any negative feelings for him, I have always loved him with the same intensity as I did when we were that age. But there is a lot of hurt that I feel because he never tried to call or even write. One day I woke up and that was it, he was gone. I'm a grown adult now and married to another woman. We are both bisexual and have had many threesomes with men in the past. I've had fantasies and dreams about us having sex with my brother, about her experiencing him. We've talked about it and she isn't open to doing that but has never judged me for my experience with him.\n\nThe thing is, I want closure from him. I need him to talk to me about it. I need him to know that he didn't ever hurt me or make me do something that I didn't want to do. I want him to know how much I love him. I miss him and how close we were, he was my best friend. I felt like we could talk about anything.\n \nTomorrow, he's going to call me and while I know we'll talk about the last few years and things that have happened I don't know how to approach the topic or if he would even want to. I don't know if he regrets it. I don't know if he misses me the way I miss him and I'm truly scared of finding out that he doesn't. We shared this unique and special moment and what if it all just meant nothing to him? I don't know. I needed to post this, I've needed to talk about it for a long time and it feels really good to have this all out. I really look forward to the responses and I hope that maybe some of you can offer me some solid advice. Thank you for reading if you've made it this far.\n\nAnd for those of that you didn't.\n\nTLDR;\nMy brother and I had a sexual relationship and it has been nearly 14 years since the last time we spoke. We're going to be speaking tomorrow for the first time and I am seeking advice on how to approach talking about it with him and getting some kind of closure.\n\n",

I don&amp;#39;t know if he regrets it. I don&amp;#39;t know if he misses me the way I miss him and I&amp;#39;m truly scared of finding out that he doesn&amp;#39;t. We shared this unique and special moment and what if it all just meant nothing to him? I don&amp;#39;t know. I needed to post this, I&amp;#39;ve needed to talk about it for a long time and it feels really good to have this all out. I really look forward to the responses and I hope that maybe some of you can offer me some solid advice. Thank you for reading if you&amp;#39;ve made it this far.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And for those of that you didn&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TLDR;\nMy brother and I had a sexual relationship and it has been nearly 14 years since the last time we spoke. We&amp;#39;re going to be speaking tomorrow for the first time and I am seeking advice on how to approach talking about it with him and getting some kind of closure.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
