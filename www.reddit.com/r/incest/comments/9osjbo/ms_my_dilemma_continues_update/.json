My mom and I live more as a couple than we do mom and son, atleast when we are at home or far away from home. I still ask for permission to sleep with her in her bed and she still invites me every night, and I like it like that, keeps things stable I think. When we make love, she is so motherly and kind and gentle, but once we are in the throes of passion, there is definitely an exchange in power and I become very dominant. I kinda glossed over everything in the beginning and leading up to our new relationship.  I was having a hard time dealing with the feelings that I was having for my mom. on the one hand, I love and trust her like no other, on the other, I was mad that she had divorced my dad and that she spent so much time \u2018finding herself\u2019 after the divorce. She spent a lot of time going out with different guys and she fell in with other girls that were younger and just basically users, for lack of better words.  \r\n\r\nMy mom is a knockout, she is so pretty and so so sexy. She has the perfect body, she\u2019s 5\u201908\u201d perfect hips, butt and breasts and everyone notices. Even girls. They used her for what they could\u2026rides, bait for other guys, you get the idea. She started picking up those habits and started using guys to get what she wanted, and from my experience, that\u2019s most women do, but not when they are my moms age.\r\n\r\nShe\u2019s incredibly lucky nothing ever happened to her, she would dump me off on my grandparents while she\u2019d go out and she would bring guys back to our home and do their thing then they\u2019d leave.  She didn\u2019t think I knew but I did\u2026she still doesn\u2019t know that I know. She started seriously dating one guy and I really liked him, a lot.  He was nice to us, he took us places and paid for everything. He was so cool with her, he encouraged her to go out with her friends and would even drop her off and pick her up if she didn\u2019t have a ride to go dancing. He treated me like his own and I started seeing him as a father figure and role model. He taught me a lot of cool stuff that a father should teach his son, stuff my dad should have taught me but was too busy with his life. He was in love with her but she just didn\u2019t have it in her to love anyone but herself, sometimes, I don\u2019t think she even loved herself. She chewed him up and wore him out. He lasted 2 years before he had enough and left. I\u2019m pretty sure she cheated on him. Several times. So all of this weighed on me, on top of my sexual feelings for her. Even with all the hints she was giving me, I was worried she was just curious and this would end badly.\r\n\r\nAs a result of all of this, coupled with our newfound lifestyle, some things have started to manifest, hence why I\u2019ve been away for so long, just trying to make sense of it all. I think some of my frustrations and anger have manifested in my assumed role with my mom. I\u2019ve become very dominant and as a result, my mom has accepted her role as the submissive one of the relationship. We have sex whenever I want it, whether she\u2019s ready/willing or not. I take it and have claimed her for myself. I\u2019m convinced she is in it for the long haul and is committed to her and I. She has almost no desire to go out or to even dance as she LOVES dancing. She loves spending time with me, just her and I. She smothers like a mother does but she\u2019s cool about giving me space as I am with her.\r\n\r\nWe took a small excursion awhile back to a place we read about in Fort Bragg, about 3-4 hours from where we live, in Northern California. It was super nice, old but comfy. She\u2019s become spoiled and has a taste for the expensive, but when it\u2019s just her and I, that seems to fade. We had access to a private beach where we spent a lot of time, as well as access to all of the motels amenities like the bonfire pits and gym. I was up in the room when mom went down stairs to get her phone charger from the car. She\u2019d been gone for awhile so I looked outside and saw her chatting with one of the grounds keepers. It looked innocent enough, but still, I felt a little threatened and jealous. I started to get turned on at the same time. As I was getting hard, I decided that I was going to have her as soon as she got back into the room.  I went to her make up kit and found a small tub of bag balm, my old friend \ud83d\ude02, that I had stashed in the event we needed lube. I like it\u2019s consistency and it\u2019s not nearly as messy as KY or astraglide\u2026I rubbed it all over my dick and waited until she came back. As soon as she walked in the door, I got off the bed, she started to say something when I turned her around, lifted up her top, pulled down her yoga pants and thong in one motion and quickly, but carefully pushed her against the wall, Face first and took her from behind.  It was a tight fit as usual but the lube really makes it so much easier\u2026I slipped right in, the whole time, she\u2019s letting out small moans and grunts  until she let out an \u2018ahhh\u2019 of pain mixed with pleasure when I was inside her. \r\n\r\nAfter we had sex for what seemed like a good 45-60 min, we started to talk, while still nibbling and exploring each other\u2019s bodies, she confessed to me that she thought it was really hot that I took her and had my way with her and, as a result,  we\u2019ve dabbled in play rape and we both like it a lot. We also talked in great detail about where that came from and she was turned on that I care so much that I was jealous but that she didn\u2019t like that I was hurt or threatened. I told her that it was a turn on and that I might enjoy the cuckold aspect of it. She agreed that it\u2019s something we should explore and that she\u2019d be willing to try it and see if we both like it. I\u2019m worried about a lot of things. I\u2019m worried this may only be a phase for her and that soon, she\u2019ll be over \u2018this\u2019 and want to move on or, this is a means to an end for her. I don\u2019t know. She can be manipulative. I\u2019m in it for the long haul and I think she is too but I\u2019m still a little hesitant.  \r\n\r\nWhen we got home from our trip, it was business as usual for us. One night, she called me into her room and she was standing there in front of the mirror, naked, getting ready for bed when she called me over\u2026we hugged and kissed and then she started to touch my dick\u2026she asked me if I\u2019d like to her to shave it for me and I thought it was a great idea and that I would like to try it.  She then slowly wrapped one arm around my waist and started to jack me off with her other, all the while, holding me agains the counter to sturdy ourselves.  She started to bite on my chest, neck and nipples until I was about to explode, then she\u2019d slow down and start stroking me again\u2026this went on for over 30 minutes, I was sweating and starting to get tired but so ready to cum when she started telling me she wants to try a threesome, she wants to see another girl pleasure me while she watches. That\u2019s when I told her that I want to watch her with not one but two men. She suddenly stopped stroking me, looked me in the eye and sternly said \u2018Fuck me...fuck me right now, I want you to fuck me as hard as you can, right now!\u2019\ud83d\ude33\r\n\r\nMore to come...",
