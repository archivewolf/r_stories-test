I've never talked to anyone about this. Just a heads up: it's kind of a long post, and pretty tame.\n\nAfter my parents divorced, my dad married an old college friend of his, a widow and mother to two daughters who were the same approximate ages as my brother and me. As with most blended families, things were rough going at first, smoothed out as time passed, and we all eventually came to refer to each other in regular familial terms (brother, sister, mom, dad, all without the \u201cstep\u201d prefix). Honestly, it was just easier, and we, we four siblings at least, had been a family together longer than we hadn\u2019t.\n\nDuring my late teens and early twenties, I had grown pretty close to my step-sister Andrea (not her real name). She was six months older than me, a grade ahead, and just cool and easy to talk to. My younger step-sister, Michelle (not her real name), was quieter and sometimes moody, and we were never really close growing up, but we got along and liked each other well enough.\n\nCut to the fall of 2006, and we\u2019re all in our mid-20\u2019s. Michelle is 23, and attending a big state university and dating a guy who my step-mom constantly remarks reminds her of me. And when I met him I was actually kind of shocked at how much we resembled each other \u2014 both tall, dark eyes, dark hair cut in the same style, broad shoulders, soft-spoken, history majors with delusions of grad school. I only met him a couple of times and liked him well enough, and he seemed to make Michelle happy. But the resemblance\u2026 A person wonders, ya know? For those curious, I was 25, and sometimes likened to a young Vince Vaughn.\n\nQuick aside, around this time Michelle was very fit \u2014 she danced with a troupe at school and constantly worked out. She was built like the glamour model Erica Campbell (look her up if you don\u2019t know her), and resembled a cross between Jennifer Aniston and Kristen Wiig in her looks (she\u2019s still gorgeous, don\u2019t get me wrong, but she was positively smoking then). I found one of her bras in the laundry around that time (snooping horndog that I was), and was unsurprised to find out she wore a 32 DD. Like I said, smoking. Great boobs, great ass, gorgeous face. I had always been *very* attracted to her, wanted her to like me even, but had always felt that she was out of my league.\n\nLate that summer I had moved back home with my folks after a couple of abortive semesters at school. I was having trouble getting my life together, figuring it all out or whatever, and was pretty depressed. My folks gave me a small room in the finished basement. It emptied out to an open living room with a large bathroom easily accessible right by a loveseat. Michelle was also living at home at the time, saving a little money by staying in her old room on the second floor.\n\nA few weeks after I moved in, Michelle found out the guy she was dating had been cheating on her. She immediately broke up with him, and I remember her and my step-mom having long conversations into the night, Michelle often crying. My room was immediately under the first floor living room, and I could hear their voices through the register in the ceiling.\n\nI felt awful for her. Even though we had never been that close, we had always gotten along and I loved her like a real sister. One day, my step-mom, her mom, came up with the idea of me taking Michelle out to cheer her up, and we had the perfect opportunity for doing so: Michelle\u2019s ex had bought them tickets to the touring show for the musical Chicago, and my step-mom thought I should take Michelle to see the show (Michelle loved Chicago at the time, anything with smoky jazz and song and dance routines). I thought of how miserable Michelle had been and agreed that it was a great idea. The show was that weekend.\n\nThat Saturday, Michelle and I dressed up a little. Nothing too fancy. I wore slacks and a shirt and tie, and she wore dark pants and a tight maroon sweater she favored (I rather liked her in it, too). We chatted in the car on the way to the show, talking about school, our past loves, and just generally catching each other up on our lives. It was kind of the first time we had done that since I had moved in. It was good, and the conversation was easy and we laughed a lot. The show was good, too. Michelle loved it, and after it was over she gave me a big hug and thanked me for taking her. I remember looking down at her when she hugged me, and after a few seconds she looked up at me and her eyes were\u2026 not watery, but kind of dreamy and gooey, all affection and love. It clearly meant a lot to her that we had gone together. I broke the hug and she laughed and said something like, \u201cPeople probably think we\u2019re a couple.\u201d I laughed, too, and we left for the parking lot. We may have gotten drinks or a quick bite after that, but I can\u2019t remember exactly.\n\nAfter that night, Michelle and I started doing almost everything together, and we started getting much closer than we ever had been before. We went to the movies together, went out to eat together, went shopping together. Sometimes I\u2019d pay for everything, sometimes she would, sometimes we\u2019d split whatever bill we had. We constantly made jokes about being mistaken for a couple, about how weird it was, and whenever we were mistaken for a couple (often by waitstaff) we\u2019d just laugh and blush. My step-mom would even tease us about how we were practice dating each other.\n\nBefore you read on, I should tell you that Michelle and I never had sex, and we never *really* fooled around, but in everything we did together, the possibility that it might ever be something more always seemed just around the corner, just out of sight, like it only would have taken one of us to acknowledge it for it to become reality. I think we were kind of falling for one another. I knew I was falling for her, at least. She was smart and sassy and just absolutely gorgeous. She wasn't afraid to be herself around me, and I was growing more comfortable around her. With her, I learned how to really talk and communicate with women, without pretense or pick up lines or whatever. I had these competing feelings of brotherly love and romantic and sexual attraction.\n\nWe spent a lot of time together at home, too. Watching movies or TV or just talking late into the night. She started spending her evenings with me in the basement living room. One night, I got home late from work (I was waiting tables at the time) and went to take a shower in the basement bathroom. I didn\u2019t grab a change of clothes, just marched into the bathroom, stripped my work clothes off, and jumped in the shower. I opened the bathroom door a short time later, naked and drying myself off with a towel. Michelle was sitting on the couch against the far wall, watching TV, and got a good and complete look at just about everything. Mind you, it was late, after midnight, and when I came home there wasn\u2019t a light on in her bedroom window, so I didn\u2019t expect to see her or anyone else down there at all.\n\nHer eyes got very wide and she quickly turned pink. \u201cOoops!\u201d she said, and I covered myself and rushed into my room and closed the door. I came out a minute later, dried and dressed. Michelle said something like, \u201cSorry, I didn\u2019t know that was going to happen.\u201d She was supremely embarrassed. I didn\u2019t make a big deal of it and went upstairs to make some popcorn. When I came back downstairs I sat on the loveseat across the room from the couch, and watched TV with Michelle. She asked if I would share the popcorn and I said sure. She came to the love seat, told me to scoot over, and sat down beside me. She apologized again for what had happened, and I said it was ok, no big deal. After we finished the popcorn we cuddled while watching TV. It wasn\u2019t the first time we had done it, but after that night it became a more frequent occurrence, and we\u2019d sometimes share the larger couch, one of us draping our legs across the other\u2019s lap.\n\nWe fell into this groove pretty easily, and at one point we started watching movies together in my room. I can\u2019t remember exactly how or why or who suggested it, but it happened. The TV was closer to my bed and watching movies while lying on the bed was just more comfortable. I came home late from work one night and Michelle was up, waiting for me in the basement. She couldn\u2019t sleep and wanted to watch some movies and hang out. I was totally open to it, as I always needed to unwind after work no matter how late. After showering (with a change of clothes handy), we hopped on my bed and started watching a dvd. I can\u2019t remember what movie it was, but after it was over, Michelle asked if I was up for another movie. I was, and so we popped another one in.\n\nSometime later, I\u2019m not sure how much later, I woke up. The only light came from the TV. The movie had ended and was back at the dvd menu. But more importantly, I woke up spooning Michelle. We were wearing light bed clothes, old shorts and t-shirts and the like. My dick was hard and growing harder, right against her ass. My arm was draped across her, and around it she had wound her own arm so that her hand was on top of mine. She began to squirm and her breathing changed, and she moved her ass against my dick. I lifted my arm to move away; I thought she was sleeping, dreaming. But she guided my hand to her boob and pressed it against her. She began to grind a little harder and guided my hand under her shirt and moved it to her breast. I remember her breath caught when I touched her nipple. I lifted her shirt up and looked at her boobs as best I could from the angle I was at (they were awesome, and in the cool blue light of the TV, her big areolas and little nipples seemed to be the same color as the rest of her skin). I could feel a pretty intense heat growing from where she was grinding against me.\n\nI got bold and moved my hand down her tight stomach and toward the waist of her shorts. She stopped moving, and turned to look me in the eyes. She said something like, \u201cNo, not right now,\u201d and pulled her top back down. \u201cWe should sleep.\u201d She sat up and pulled the blanket from the foot of the bed over her, wrapped herself in it, and snuggled up against me again. Her breathing soon changed again and I could tell she was sleeping.\n\nI lay there for what felt like hours, dumbstruck. Eventually, I slowly and quietly got off the bed and went to the bathroom to take care of myself. When I came back Michelle was gone and the TV was off. We didn\u2019t talk about it the next day. I think we were each waiting for the other to broach the subject, and when neither of us did, well, that was kind of it. Our dates together slowed to a trickle, and she moved out of my parent\u2019s home after Christmas of \u201906. All told, we practice-dated each other for a little over two months.\n\nBut the story\u2019s not over quite yet. In the summer of 2007, Andrea, Michelle, and I all moved into a rented house together. It was a pretty small house, with only two bedrooms and one bathroom, all on the second floor. The house was old, and had a partially finished basement, one open room that the stairway emptied into, and that was my room. Through a door by the end of the stairs was the unfinished part of the basement and the laundry, so the girls would regularly have to go through my room to do their laundry.\n\nThere was also a laundry chute that emptied into that area, and it went all the way to the second floor. It had a little access door in the stairway into the basement, too. Around this time, Michelle started actually dating again, and soon found the guy that would become her husband (they got married *real* fast, too, within less than five months of their first date). There were a few times late at night when I could hear them through the laundry chute, as the second-floor access was right outside her door, and likely adjacent or even attached to ductwork. They fucked like rabbits, and the noises Michelle made drove me wild. The few times I heard them going at it, I opened the chute access in the basement stairway to hear Michelle moan and cry out, and I masturbated furiously, thinking of that night that, despite not being all that long ago at the time, now felt like ancient history.\n\nWe never talked about that night, ever, and we grew a little distant after she married, and more so after I did. After my divorce and eventual engagement to a different woman, we started growing close again, but of course it\u2019s nothing like it was before. I definitely have a brother\u2019s love for her (and still find her very attractive), and she\u2019s been happily married eleven years now, with two kids, and I\u2019ll be married soon, too. But if spouses and significant others weren\u2019t in the picture, I\u2019d like to think that now, after all these years, I\u2019d finally bring up what happened that night, and who knows? As we've grown closer recently, I've found myself thinking more and more about our time together way back when. Not just \"the moment\" we shared, but the closeness we felt then, the love.",

I can\u2019t remember what movie it was, but after it was over, Michelle asked if I was up for another movie. I was, and so we popped another one in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sometime later, I\u2019m not sure how much later, I woke up. The only light came from the TV. The movie had ended and was back at the dvd menu. But more importantly, I woke up spooning Michelle. We were wearing light bed clothes, old shorts and t-shirts and the like. My dick was hard and growing harder, right against her ass. My arm was draped across her, and around it she had wound her own arm so that her hand was on top of mine. She began to squirm and her breathing changed, and she moved her ass against my dick. I lifted my arm to move away; I thought she was sleeping, dreaming. But she guided my hand to her boob and pressed it against her. She began to grind a little harder and guided my hand under her shirt and moved it to her breast. I remember her breath caught when I touched her nipple. I lifted her shirt up and looked at her boobs as best I could from the angle I was at (they were awesome, and in the cool blue light of the TV, her big areolas and little nipples seemed to be the same color as the rest of her skin). I could feel a pretty intense heat growing from where she was grinding against me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got bold and moved my hand down her tight stomach and toward the waist of her shorts. She stopped moving, and turned to look me in the eyes. She said something like, \u201cNo, not right now,\u201d and pulled her top back down. \u201cWe should sleep.\u201d She sat up and pulled the blanket from the foot of the bed over her, wrapped herself in it, and snuggled up against me again. Her breathing soon changed again and I could tell she was sleeping.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I lay there for what felt like hours, dumbstruck. Eventually, I slowly and quietly got off the bed and went to the bathroom to take care of myself. When I came back Michelle was gone and the TV was off. We didn\u2019t talk about it the next day. I think we were each waiting for the other to broach the subject, and when neither of us did, well, that was kind of it. Our dates together slowed to a trickle, and she moved out of my parent\u2019s home after Christmas of \u201906. All told, we practice-dated each other for a little over two months.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the story\u2019s not over quite yet. In the summer of 2007, Andrea, Michelle, and I all moved into a rented house together. It was a pretty small house, with only two bedrooms and one bathroom, all on the second floor. The house was old, and had a partially finished basement, one open room that the stairway emptied into, and that was my room. Through a door by the end of the stairs was the unfinished part of the basement and the laundry, so the girls would regularly have to go through my room to do their laundry.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There was also a laundry chute that emptied into that area, and it went all the way to the second floor. It had a little access door in the stairway into the basement, too. Around this time, Michelle started actually dating again, and soon found the guy that would become her husband (they got married &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; fast, too, within less than five months of their first date). There were a few times late at night when I could hear them through the laundry chute, as the second-floor access was right outside her door, and likely adjacent or even attached to ductwork. They fucked like rabbits, and the noises Michelle made drove me wild. The few times I heard them going at it, I opened the chute access in the basement stairway to hear Michelle moan and cry out, and I masturbated furiously, thinking of that night that, despite not being all that long ago at the time, now felt like ancient history.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We never talked about that night, ever, and we grew a little distant after she married, and more so after I did. After my divorce and eventual engagement to a different woman, we started growing close again, but of course it\u2019s nothing like it was before. I definitely have a brother\u2019s love for her (and still find her very attractive), and she\u2019s been happily married eleven years now, with two kids, and I\u2019ll be married soon, too. But if spouses and significant others weren\u2019t in the picture, I\u2019d like to think that now, after all these years, I\u2019d finally bring up what happened that night, and who knows? As we&amp;#39;ve grown closer recently, I&amp;#39;ve found myself thinking more and more about our time together way back when. Not just &amp;quot;the moment&amp;quot; we shared, but the closeness we felt then, the love.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
