The general manager called me into her office and asked if I really told my coworkers that I have a sexual relationship with my mother. I decided to deny the allegations and after explaining myself she said my employment ends in two weeks. \n\nWhile that wasn't pleasant at least I dodged the legal consequences as no actual proof exist now and I denied it all for my mother's sake once I realized how foolishly impulsive I acted. And if anyone does tell the cops my mother is good friends with the local police chief along with two cops that actually live in our neighborhood. So I'm %100 sure he would take our word over some punks that I worked with. \n\nThe issue is that now my mother feels guilt over seducing me and really didn't like it when I told her I don't see myself in the future with any other woman. She ended up arguing with me about how one day I need to get a real wife later on. \n\nSo I asked her why even start this in the first place. She replied that she wanted to relive her youth and after jumping into this told herself having sex with me would boost my self image enough to go after girls my own age. \n\nTold my mother again that I only want her and that other girl's don't appeal to me at all. Also said our relationship as a whole matters more than sex. My mother then demanded to know why I wouldn't go after other girls. I told my mother it's because I could never trust them while I trust her wholeheartedly.  \n\nShe turned away and started crying saying what she did to me while drunk was wrong. I told her if I didn't like it that I wouldn't have had sex with her the following morning. Also said I would never have thought to do something like that and that I feel very grateful for her expressing love this way. \n\nThen my mother got even more upset and told me I didn't understand. She refused to talk about it anymore after that and now I feel quite depressed tonight. Mostly because I don't know how to relief her of the guilt she is feeling when I don't think what she did was wrong. \n\nSorry my first post read so immature, in part that happened because I stayed up late and I had never felt more excited. Also apologize for less than good writing as I was held back twice in school due to failing English class.      ",

I'm autistic myself and although it's been difficult, I'm miles ahead of where I was socially at 20. I learned to interact with people by diving into the social realm and gaining experience (by which I mean I've screwed up in numerous ways, so many that I'm still realizing new ones years later). Autism doesn't make social interaction imposaible, it just means you have trouble picking up things that come naturally to most people, but hard experience (and/or a guide/mentor of some sort who can explain to you the things you miss in social situations, something I've rarely had) can cut through that barrier.",
