                        "body": "It's really very difficult if he doesn't seem to be interested in you.\n\nUsually,many boys develop a crush on their moms as they love, and are loved by them unconditionally and are always around. The women don't have to be very attractive but it helps to be so.\n\nMany move on and form relationships with girls their age. What I feel is that many--and I might appear fatalistic here-incestuous relationships develop spontaneously and not necessarily due to circumstantial compulsions. Then there is no problem of rejection. Some do develop under unfortunate circumstances such as widowhood and the woman turning to the son for support but again the son may provide emotional support without getting sexually involved. Some sons are just waiting to be invited.\n\nI wouldn't be very pessimistic in your case.He still loves you. You haven't mentioned if your husband is around and  you have other children.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou have tried dressing sexy around him. Can you elaborate?\n\nAt times, some plan such as asking him about your form while standing  in your underclothes at night might draw his attention. At other,a bit adventurous act such as letting him check your breasts for imaginary lumps when he gets to touch and press them might help. If he develops an erection,you can ask him to show you that and that is usually the routine beginning.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can't suggest,straightaway,exposing your nether region but some women do try that--it might put him off  too.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have known a case where a woman used to sit around in her underclothes graduating to being naked. She had told him to not feel shy and he got used to that.Then she asked him to get naked,taking advantage of the hot weather.He did sit naked(how stupid could he be without being interested) but strange as it may sound,they never had sex though she was desperate. She also tried to get him in the bathroom while taking bath and scrub ( again he complained about it to a counsellor but scrubbed her anyway) her,mentioning functions of her anatomy while he did it. Reportedly,this went on quite a while but he never tapped the situation to enjoy himself (and that could happen in your case as well).\n\nUnfortunately for HER,it never progressed to incest and instead he wrote to a forum where he was advised to get psychiatric help for her. That must have been humiliating for her,if he acted on that too after having stripped for her and scrubbed her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn other case,a woman whose husband was a travelling salesman and she used to be alone with her handsome son( her words). He was very popular with girls in college( again her words).She started seducing him and luckily for her,he succumbed.\n\nNow they are very happily in an incestuous relationship,without the husband discovering their little secret. She ,especially,was very happy since he was very romantic as well,getting her flowers and chocolates regularly.\n\nSo,how it will result in your case is very difficult to predict. I just hope,your efforts don't backfire.\n\nBe careful and best luck.",

                        "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s really very difficult if he doesn&amp;#39;t seem to be interested in you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Usually,many boys develop a crush on their moms as they love, and are loved by them unconditionally and are always around. The women don&amp;#39;t have to be very attractive but it helps to be so.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Many move on and form relationships with girls their age. What I feel is that many--and I might appear fatalistic here-incestuous relationships develop spontaneously and not necessarily due to circumstantial compulsions. Then there is no problem of rejection. Some do develop under unfortunate circumstances such as widowhood and the woman turning to the son for support but again the son may provide emotional support without getting sexually involved. Some sons are just waiting to be invited.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wouldn&amp;#39;t be very pessimistic in your case.He still loves you. You haven&amp;#39;t mentioned if your husband is around and  you have other children.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You have tried dressing sexy around him. Can you elaborate?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At times, some plan such as asking him about your form while standing  in your underclothes at night might draw his attention. At other,a bit adventurous act such as letting him check your breasts for imaginary lumps when he gets to touch and press them might help. If he develops an erection,you can ask him to show you that and that is usually the routine beginning.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t suggest,straightaway,exposing your nether region but some women do try that--it might put him off  too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have known a case where a woman used to sit around in her underclothes graduating to being naked. She had told him to not feel shy and he got used to that.Then she asked him to get naked,taking advantage of the hot weather.He did sit naked(how stupid could he be without being interested) but strange as it may sound,they never had sex though she was desperate. She also tried to get him in the bathroom while taking bath and scrub ( again he complained about it to a counsellor but scrubbed her anyway) her,mentioning functions of her anatomy while he did it. Reportedly,this went on quite a while but he never tapped the situation to enjoy himself (and that could happen in your case as well).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately for HER,it never progressed to incest and instead he wrote to a forum where he was advised to get psychiatric help for her. That must have been humiliating for her,if he acted on that too after having stripped for her and scrubbed her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In other case,a woman whose husband was a travelling salesman and she used to be alone with her handsome son( her words). He was very popular with girls in college( again her words).She started seducing him and luckily for her,he succumbed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now they are very happily in an incestuous relationship,without the husband discovering their little secret. She ,especially,was very happy since he was very romantic as well,getting her flowers and chocolates regularly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So,how it will result in your case is very difficult to predict. I just hope,your efforts don&amp;#39;t backfire.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Be careful and best luck.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
