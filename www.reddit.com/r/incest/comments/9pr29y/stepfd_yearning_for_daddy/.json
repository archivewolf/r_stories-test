I'm usually a wide open book, so this is the first time I've dealt with something and been unable to tell anybody about it at all. So, I never met my real father. I'm in my late twenties. Recently, my moms ex-husband has entered back into my life. I don't remember having a great relationship with him when they were married, but now that I'm older and we've bonded, its incredible. I swear I could talk to him for days on end and never get bored. He has been so incredible and supportive. I finally, FINALLY have someone I can call a father.\n\nNow its not news to me that I have this psychological daddy fixation, I am the stereotypical daddy issues girl 100%. My last relationship had a DDLG dynamic. But now that I finally have a father figure in my life, I'm going crazy with these feelings for him. Every time I see him its too short, every time he leaves I wish he would come back, every hug I just want to hold on longer and longer. It all started one day when I was sitting in the car, and he hopped out to do something, and I just sat there watching him....admiring him. It was in that moment that I realized, fuck, hes HOT. Even crazier, he shares a birthday with my first love and even resembles him physically. \n\nNow I have no idea if he would ever share these feelings, never mind acting on them. We seem to share the same outlook on most everything in life, and have fun bonding over our unique way of thinking. Besides the fact that I may be crazy for thinking he would return the feelings or dare to act on them, there is a HUGE problem - he is married. To make things even worse, she seems like an AMAZING sweetheart. I don't want to be some homewrecker, and my policy is passionately all about open honesty and authenticity. But even if we ever shared something, it obviously would have to be in complete secret, anyway. I cant believe I'm even saying this because its against everything I stand for, but what she wouldnt know wouldnt hurt her, right? The secretive thing is SUCH a thrill. I don't want a very serious relationship here, I want a casual thing where I see him a couple times a week and talk and share - just like we do now - but I want there to be...more. Physically, affectionately. I cant even believe I'm saying this for real.\n\nI haven't acted on it, but I've started dropping tiny hints. I have been hugging him tighter and holding on longer and I got super close with him on the couch the last time I saw him, sitting right up against him. I linked my arm in his as we walked together, and drunkenly insisted on hugging him goodbye 3 separate times. Something tells me they don't have a very active sex life if any, everyone has needs... and I finally have someone I feel safe around. I feel like I could have a chance, because he's not an idiot and I'm sure he's already at least intuitively sensed that something is up.\n\nI don't want to fuck up the fact that I FINALLY have a father figure. But, I cannot think of anything else. I LOVE the taboo, and have been aware of my fascination with incest ever since I had an incestuous dream years ago and it was one of the hottest things I had ever experienced - I was dripping wet and obsessed all day after that dream. At first I felt like something was seriously wrong with me, but I've grown to accept that there is no denying how intensely hot it is. \n\nI feel like everyone here is just going to say \"fuck off, hes married\" and I agree but then how in the world do I get past these feelings? Just thinking about it is SUCH a rush and for days I haven't been able to think about anything else, I just keep lurking here and fantasizing (and finding excuses to try to see him). I know that if I pursued this it would be one of the most intense and thrilling experiences of my life. Just sitting in his presence makes me feel amazing. I don't know what to do.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

I want him to hold me so tight that we're not even two separate bodies anymore. I am SO PENT UP about this in every way... and things really unfolded last night, we don't usually hug upon arrival but when I answered the door yesterday I went out of my way to hug him and when I went to pull away he pulled me back in. It was definitely drawn out. It made me so so so happy. Then I started inching closer and closer to him on the couch and at one point he was making a point about how he really cares for me and how he's there for me and put his hand on my shoulder or something so I just dove right into the snuggle and refused to move. Not that he did anything to try and make me move, but I think he may have felt strange holding me like that. And I pretty much stayed glued to his side after that. Then, he damn near crashed the car as we were driving so I believe this is becoming very obvious to him and I just hope he's not too fucked up about it. Actually now that I'm typing this out I'm realizing that I should probably just speak up and get this out in the open before it gets too confusing and conflicting for him. Yikes.",

Then I started inching closer and closer to him on the couch and at one point he was making a point about how he really cares for me and how he&amp;#39;s there for me and put his hand on my shoulder or something so I just dove right into the snuggle and refused to move. Not that he did anything to try and make me move, but I think he may have felt strange holding me like that. And I pretty much stayed glued to his side after that. Then, he damn near crashed the car as we were driving so I believe this is becoming very obvious to him and I just hope he&amp;#39;s not too fucked up about it. Actually now that I&amp;#39;m typing this out I&amp;#39;m realizing that I should probably just speak up and get this out in the open before it gets too confusing and conflicting for him. Yikes.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
