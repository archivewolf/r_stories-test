Despite feeling nervous as hell (every waking moment felt like my stomach had somersaulted), I hinted about the relationship to my mom. Either she didn't understand where I was coming from or she was trying to defend herself.\n\nThe next week was where it escalated. I still felt nervous around them, but dying to just spill it and let them know. My uncle arrived at the house and my mom suggested I go out for a few hours. I left for half an hour, then returned. I heard them having sex but I stayed in my room for the time. I just sat there, mostly out of fear/adrenaline.\n\nAfter about two hours my mom and uncle left the room talking about taking a shower together, and I suddenly remembered that the main bathroom shower was broken. The only other one was beside my room, and they needed to go through my room to use it. I wanted to get out but I couldn't even hide properly without them noticing me... So I \"hid\" behind the door, terrified.\n\nThey went into my bedroom laughing and kissing. My uncle was carrying mom. I'm not going to lie it was a beautiful sight seeing them in love, despite being scared shitless.... Then my mom saw me. She cried almost instantly while my uncle seemed lost for words. All I could say was \"It's ok\" but mom still cried.\n\nSo after an hour of them begging for forgiveness, ignoring that I kept telling them I'm ok with it, we started to talk about it. I sat between them and they discussed how it started. Essentially mom had been seeing my uncle around the time she divorced my dad. I suspect it had been happening before then but I chose not to make her upset again. I told them that I \"figured\" they were together months ago, not mentioning that I saw them having sex on vacation. I also told them that I think it's great to see them happy (which is true) and they don't need to hide it from me. Then we all had a big emotional hug and stuff.\n\nThe following weeks has had a good vibe in the household. Mom and uncle openly show their love in front of me, and I'm not ashamed to admit it now but it turns me on. They don't know that, and I personally wouldn't want to join them. I just like the fact that my mom's new boyfriend is her *brother*.\n\nIf anything 'new' happens I'll update.",
