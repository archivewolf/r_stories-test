Before I start explaining things, I'll get the parts out of the way that most people going to object to. I'm married and she's married, and we're both in our low 30's. In the case of any other woman, I wouldn't pursue anything even close to cheating on my wife and I wouldn't pursue a married woman either. Read the rest before you get too worked up over this aspect.\n\nSo onto my feelings. They're not the conventional sibling incest feelings. I don't want a pursue a romantic relationship with her, but at the same time it's not just pure lust. We have our own lives that I wouldn't want us to uproot and abandon for a romantic relationship, and though we're great friends I question if we'd be compatible in a see-each-other-every-day situation of a romantic relationship. At the same time, assuming if she were interested, I don't just want to fuck her like some sexual conquest. I love her as a sister and we're very close. I feel like if we did anything physical that it would be a layer on top of that where it'd be very intimate and make me feel even closer to her. Obviously if that were to happen I wouldn't be telling anyone, but at the same time it wouldn't feel like I was cheating (I know people will argue that it doesn't matter if I feel like it is or not, just the fact that it would be). We don't get to see each other very often so even if anything happened it'd just be a occasional thing every once in a while.\n\nI'll probably be seeing her sometime this month. My plan probably isn't the most graceful, but basically I'm going to have to start by blurting something out, else if I try to delicately draw it out I'll probably get too scared to give her the big reveal. Basically once we have some privacy I plan on telling her she's beautiful and I have a physical crush on her. Assuming she doesn't freak out too much for me continue, then I want to go on to explain basically what I mentioned here about that doesn't mean I want to run off together to have a romantic relationship nor do I want to treat her as some conquest to be had. I want to reassure her that all my brotherly love has been genuine and that if anything came from this it would just be a layer on top of that. I'd also (probably earlier in the conversation) tell him that I'm not naive thinking this confession is going to work wonders to me, that I'm basically assuming she's not going to be receptive and that I primarily just want to get this off of my chest (which I really do).\n\nShe's never got all handsy or anything to lead me on to believe she's interested, but then again never have I really because I didn't want to potentially put her physically in a very uncomfortable situation if she wasn't interested.

However, she has told me extremely explicit details of her sex life (like when I asked for advice technique for going down on a woman she told exactly how she likes. Not \"well, most women like it when...\", but \"well, I like it when...\".) Again, that could just be her being very comfortable talking to me about anything.\n\nBasically, most logical analyzing of our sibling relationship doesn't give me much reason to think she might be interested. However, at the same time sometimes I get a vibe or gut feeling that she might be. Vibes and gut feelings aren't typical for me, so sometimes I just wonder if it's my mind playing tricks on me a little via optimism.
