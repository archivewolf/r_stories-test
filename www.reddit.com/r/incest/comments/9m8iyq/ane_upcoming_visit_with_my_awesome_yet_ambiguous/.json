She's a gamer, super-smart, and  has at least DD breasts. That all said, for the most part, I've kept my crush to myself, and things between us have been mostly innocent\n\n...But... \n\nOne summer in 2015 things took a turn...I was about 23 or so, and she was about 31. I'd used some vacation time to visit her in the big city. Being single, my trips to visit her are often paired with solo nights out on the city, in (mostly-failed) attempts to get laid. After one such night out by myself, I returned to her house, only to find her playing PS3. Not turning her gaze from the screen, her first words were: \n\n\"So, nephew, did you get laid?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeep in mind, although my aunt and I are really close, we'd never really touched the subject of sex. Immediately turned on, I told her I hadn't  but sure as hell tried. The conversation then turned into an entire litany of experiences we'd had sexually, and continued for about an hour. Hearing her talk so openly about sex of course made me freaking BRICK HARD. I was so horny by the time she retired for the evening, that it took probably about 5 seconds to get myself off, which I did 3 times that night.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFrom that day forward, a few interesting things started to happen between us. For one, when I visit, she doesn't seem to mind occasionally walking out of the bathroom in towels which barely cover her large breasts. (And she knows I love big breasts.) Two, she rarely wears bras at home, and I OPENLY stare at her chest while talking. Three, we often text each  other about ridiculously-sexual subjects openly. Ranging from masturbation habits, preferences on oral sex, the pull out method, among other things. The most infamous was when I drunk texted her while HAVING sex, and told her all the nasty things I was doing to the girl I'd been screwing.I plan on visiting her next month... And, needless-to-say, I'm looking forward to it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo that's a brief history of my relationship with my amazingly-cool aunt. Now a few questions.\n\n1. Am I over-thinking all of this? Does it seem like she's clearly sexually interested, or does it seem like she's clearly just being friendly?\n2. What are some ways I could flirt with her, to test the waters?\n3. I really would like to cuddle with my aunt. Is that innocent enough to ask a family member?\n4. I know she masturbates with toys (she's mentioned that before, and even offered to buy me one). Would it be weird if I bought her one?\n5. Has anyone been in a similar situation? If so, any other miscellaneous advice would be helpful.\n\n\\[tl;dr\\]  - My aunt is freaking awesome, and we talk very openly about sex. I have a visit coming up to see her, and I'm wondering how to best enjoy this visit. I will definitely update after the trip happens. Thanks, people. \\^\\_\\^",
