It didn\u2019t just happen, it had been building for a few months.\nSo my parents had left early Thursday morning for their mini vacation. My brother had went to work and I had 2 girlfriends over to use the pool in the backyard. I went in the house to grab some drinks for us and my brother was at the table getting drinks. I didn\u2019t even know he was home yet. Playfully I went up and gave him a peck on the cheek, said something like back from work already hunny? I laughed and walked back out to my friends. A short while after my brother came out in his bathing suit but we were already drying off. We had plans to go grab something to eat. \nWhile we were at the restaurant my brother texted me and said it was too bad that we left he wanted to hang out and go for a swim with us. I replied something like yeah of course you did, who wouldn\u2019t with 3 hotties like us (these were 2 of my best friends, we cheered together through middle school and HS, one of them actually came to college with me a few months later, definitely cute girls) maybe when we get back we can jump in the pool. \nHe didn\u2019t respond but when I got home he was watching TV on the couch. I said hello and went up to change into my bikini. When I got back downstairs he said where\u2019s your friends? They went to meet up with some guys so it was just me I said sorry to disappoint you. Are you gonna get your suit on or watch TV? By the time he got out back I was already in the pool. We were just talking and laughing regularl stuff. Splashing back and forth. I said something I forget what but I guess it was something that bothered him and he grabbed me like he was gonna dunk me or toss me under. I tried to spin away and I thought it was accident but he got a handful of boob.\nHe instantly apologized, said it was an accident, I just laughed playfully and said sure it was. We both know you\u2019ve been wanting to do that for awhile now. Still in his grip I could feel he liked grabbing it accidentally or not. So I said we should play Marco Polo. It was innocent for awhile but whenever one of us would find the other it started to get a little flirtatious by touching. Still not really inappropriate though, but then it took a turn.\nHe was calling out Marco and I stayed quiet, saying Polo real low. Out of nowhere I felt him grab me by my hips. I opened my eyes and could tell he was still excited, I laughed and said oh hey again. I didn\u2019t try to pull away though, I kind of enjoyed feeling his excitement. He just looked at me and went to kiss me, I froze, I didn\u2019t know what to think. I just went with it, we kissed for awhile and I felt his hands try to untie my bikin bottom. I put my hands over his and pulled my head back, I told him that isn\u2019t a good idea, he seemed disappointed I guess he thought he ruined his chance. I saw the disappointment in his eyes so I said you can untie my top if you want. Ya know since you already accidentally copped a feel before. I think he thought I was joking so I leaned in and kissed him. Then he untied my top, the feeling of my breasts pushed against his chest, combined with the hard on he had drove me absolutely insane. \nI began to wander my hands and just touched him. I rubbed it slightly and felt him start grabbing my ass. I was so turned on I just went with it. I went from tugging him above his bathing suit to sticking my hand down his trunks and giving him a hand job. \nI really can\u2019t explain the thoughts that went through my head because it felt like I couldn\u2019t think, I was overwhelmed with pleasure. He came at some point but I only knew because I felt him bite down on my lip and kind of jerk a little. \nWe ended up kissing a little more later that night on the couch but that was it. Later when I went to my room I pleasured myself for awhile, thoughts running wild of him being inside me and what I just did in the pool. \n(I will write the final post of how this all started later. Again after that though I\u2019m keeping it just most recent events and current time. I just wanted to give the background to show people how this even became what it turned out to be)",
