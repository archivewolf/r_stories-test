But here I am, so I should start somewhere I suppose.\n\nI'm a married mother of four, living with my children, husband and sister. Ostensibly my husband is who I'm referring to when I say I'm married, but I could say I'm married to my sister and it wouldn't be completely inaccurate, only legally inaccurate perhaps. Again, I don't know where to begin in terms of telling the story of our relationship. I suppose I would say we were always very close and our relationship built up over time like any other, but then it didn't stop where most sisters draw the line, and by the time we noticed it was too late to turn back, and we didn't want to anyway. I'll admit openly that while I love my husband very, very much, my sister is the love of my life, and they both know that. If I was a little bit more gay and she wasn't my sister, we would be married, I can say that with 100% certainty.\n\nWe've long since settled into a lifestyle that works for all of us. My sister gave me, my husband and our new family space for a little while before I, frankly, couldn't bare not to live with her anymore, so we're now a slightly unusual family of seven. I don't believe the older children suspect anything strange is going on, but they're smart so I suppose it's possible they do and they're just minding their own business. \n\nOnto the meat of the topic: My sister and my son are very close, possibly due to their age difference not being particularly big at 8 years, and on top of that she's a tad on the immature side while he's got a good, mature head on him. I considered them as something like best friends or close siblings, until my sisters confession of attraction towards my son. I reacted embarrassingly poorly at first, I later realized after some self-examination that I have no built-in aversion away from incest, nor do I put stake on how \"society\" thinks of it, I was simply reacting out of jealousy. But if my sister can allow me to have a husband, I can at the very least allow my sister to explore \"manly\" interests as well, even if the subject is my son.\n\nAll this has lead to discussions of a different topic. It'll be impossible to hide my relationship with my sister from my son assuming they start a relationship as well, and at what point is it silly/impossible to hide what's happening from the rest of my children? My oldest daughter at the very least will catch on immediately, if she hasn't already. And what happens if she wants to be involved somehow? And what will/should happen when me and my son inevitably encounter each other under sexual circumstances, an idea which I find... shamefully appealing, to be honest. To put it shortly, I'm wondering what will become of our family because I'm letting my sister fuck my son, and whether the end result will be disastrous or something beautiful...\n\nWell, that's about as much as I can say. Even before posting this I think getting this off my chest is doing me a world of good, but I would still appreciate any thoughts, advice, comments, anything. If there's an interest I will keep this subreddit posted on new developments.\n\n",

She's been practically exclusive to me for the longest time, I'm the one splitting my affection between two \"spouses\". And she's not having sex with him just yet, sorry for not being clear.\n\n&gt; Why do you think you and your son will encounter one another under sexual circumstances?\n\nCall it a hunch, I suppose. If we're \"sharing a woman\" we will both want her at the same time sooner or later, and I personally am warming up to the idea of some sort of play involving all three of us, maybe even my husband. I suppose it all depends on what everyone else wants.\n\nWell, as I said, my relationship with my sister has been a more or less lifelong thing like any other sibling relationship, it just evolved into a sexual one at some point. It's hard to describe how it happened, and before the breaking point we were definitely doing things that anyone else would call sexual, or even sex. It just didn't register in a way, it's like I was blinded because she was my sister, and a woman at that, and neither of those were people I should get sexual with in my mind. But I remember the first time we actively and verbally decided to \"have sex\", that was when everything settled, clicked into place. I'm sorry for being vague but I don't want to betray her privacy any more than that.\n\nAs for her wanting to fuck my son, the revelation was recent, but in hindsight the signs have been there for a long time. As I said, they act more like friends or siblings than an aunt and a nephew, I believe feelings just sort of bloomed like they would for anyone else. And I believe they're not one-sided, even if my son doesn't actively want to fuck his aunt just yet.",

She&amp;#39;s been practically exclusive to me for the longest time, I&amp;#39;m the one splitting my affection between two &amp;quot;spouses&amp;quot;. And she&amp;#39;s not having sex with him just yet, sorry for not being clear.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Why do you think you and your son will encounter one another under sexual circumstances?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Call it a hunch, I suppose. If we&amp;#39;re &amp;quot;sharing a woman&amp;quot; we will both want her at the same time sooner or later, and I personally am warming up to the idea of some sort of play involving all three of us, maybe even my husband. I suppose it all depends on what everyone else wants.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well, as I said, my relationship with my sister has been a more or less lifelong thing like any other sibling relationship, it just evolved into a sexual one at some point. It&amp;#39;s hard to describe how it happened, and before the breaking point we were definitely doing things that anyone else would call sexual, or even sex. It just didn&amp;#39;t register in a way, it&amp;#39;s like I was blinded because she was my sister, and a woman at that, and neither of those were people I should get sexual with in my mind. But I remember the first time we actively and verbally decided to &amp;quot;have sex&amp;quot;, that was when everything settled, clicked into place. I&amp;#39;m sorry for being vague but I don&amp;#39;t want to betray her privacy any more than that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As for her wanting to fuck my son, the revelation was recent, but in hindsight the signs have been there for a long time. As I said, they act more like friends or siblings than an aunt and a nephew, I believe feelings just sort of bloomed like they would for anyone else. And I believe they&amp;#39;re not one-sided, even if my son doesn&amp;#39;t actively want to fuck his aunt just yet.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
