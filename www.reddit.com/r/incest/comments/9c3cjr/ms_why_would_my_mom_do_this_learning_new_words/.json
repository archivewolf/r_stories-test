So if you are one of those who doesn't know a girl's urethra from her bartholins I suggest you get to studying. The more you know about the pussy - its parts, what they're for and and how they work the more of it you're gonna get.\nOk?\n\n\nSo Mom and I have been having this ongoing conversation for a while.\nIt started a couple of months ago when I was sitting on the barstool\u00a0 at the breakfast counter. Mom was standing in front of me and we were talking about this and that.\nI still don't know if she did it subconsciously or on purpose but she started touching my knee with her crotch.\nNot rubbing it against me but sort of casually grazing my knee with it.\n\n\nOf course I got turned on but I didn't say anything about it. \nThen she said she wanted some water and moved away to the sink. When she came back she stood farther away so I took her hand that didn't have the glass in it and pulled her toward me so her pussy would maybe touch my knee again.\nShe looked at me inquisitively and said, \n\"What?\"\nSo I said, \"I liked it when you were rubbing your pussy against my knee\"\n\n\nShe winced at the word and backed away from me then said, \"That's a dreadful word.\"\nThen with a bit of hauteur she said,\n\"I wasn't rubbing it on you either.\"\n\n\nI said, \"Well, you weren't rubbing it on me but you did touch my knee with it a couple of times.\"\n\n\n\"I did not.\"\n\n\nI said, \"Sure you did.\"\nAnd I said, \"I liked it.\"\nShe blushed a little and said, \n\n\n\"Well, I didnt do it on purpose.\u00a0 Then as if to change the subject said,\u00a0 \"That's a dreadful word.\"\n\n\nSo I just came right out and asked, \"What word? Pussy?\"\n\n\nShe said, \"Yes! You don't need to say that around me.\"\n\"Why?\"\n\"Because it's a bad word.\"\n\n\n\"The P word is bad?\"\n\n\nShe looked at me as if I was dense and said, \"Yes.\"\n\n\n\"What's so bad about it?\"\n\n\nShe said, \"Well...\"\n\n\nSo I asked, \"What should I call it?\"\n\n\nShe gave me that haughty look again and didn't say anything.\n\n\nSo I asked, \"What do you call it?\"\n\n\n\"I don't call it anything.\"\n\n\n\"You don't have a term for it?\"\n\n\n\"No. Why should I have a term for it?\"\n\n\nI said, \"So you can talk about it.\"\n\n\nThen in a dismissive way she said,\n\"Why do I need to talk about it!\" and she moved away and put the water glass by the sink and left the room.\nI let the matter drop after that but that night\u00a0 I unsnapped her pajama top and started licking her nipple like I have written about before.\nShe got very turned on and pulled her underpants down so I slowly started kissing and licking her down her chest, to\nher abdomen and on down to her pussy.\n\n\nI kissed her there for a while till she tried to pull her underpants off the rest of the way. So I pulled them off of her and licked her there till she came.\nShe pulled me to her and wanted me to fuck her but I just touched her for a while then licked her again untill she came again. \n\nThis time she was more wild and took my head and held it to her crotch and even clenched my hair in her fist to keep me there. Pulling my hair hurt a little but I kept at it till she came a second time then I got on top of her and just hammered into her till I came.\n\n\nAfterwards we lay there snuggled together and she rubbed my shoulders, back and arms in a very loving way.\nThen I said, \"What's it called?\"\n\n\n\"What's what called?\"\n\n\nI said, \"Down there.\"\n\n\nShe acted like she didn't know where i meant so I said. \"Your pussy.\"\n\nShe frowned and said, \"You're such a rude boy!\"\nThen we were sleepy and the talk was over.\nOver the course of the next few weeks I would bring it up now and then.\nOf course she showed a lot of disdain for the topic but I pressed her to tell me what she called it.\nShe said, \"I dont call it anything.\"\n\n\n\"Well, what do other women call it?\"\n\n\n\"They don't call it anything either.\nWhy do we need to call it anything?\nMy vagina?\"\n\n\nI said, \"That's too clinical and only describes the inner parts.\"\n\"My lady parts?\"\n\n\n\"Naw. Too childish.\"\n\n\nShe asked, \"Why do I have to call it anything?\"\n\n\nI said you don't have to call it anything but I find it odd that half the planet calls it your pussy and the other half can't talk about it.\"\nShe laughed and said, \"Well...\"\n\n\nAbout a week later we were coming home from a movie and I asked, \"What's it called?\"\n\n\nShe coyly asked, What's what called?\"\n\n\n\"You know.\"\n\n\nShe said\n\"Ohhh, dont make me say it.\"\n\n\n\"If you say it I will touch and kiss you there when we get home.\"\n\n\n\"And if I don't say it?\"\n\n\"Then I will go to sleep.\"\n\n\n\"Oh... Why are you so rude to your mother?\"\nShe said it, like this: \"Poooosy.\"\n\n\n\"That's close. Try again.\"\n\n\nShe said it again only quicker.\n\"Poosy.\"\n I Said, \"We'll have to keep practicing.\"\n\n\nShe said, You're such a dreadful boy.\"\n\n\nWhen we got home and went to bed I spent a long time  hugging and kissing  her everywhere. Then I licked her 'poosy' for a long time and made her come before getting on too of her and fucking her for quite a while till we both came.\nShe held me no top of her and in her for a long time afterwards then she relaxed and said, \"My lovely son. I love this sooo much with you.\"\nI said nothing but kissed her many times.\nThe following\u00a0 Wednesday we went to our dance class and when we finally got to dance together I whispered,\n\"What's it called?\"\nShe smirked at me and lightly brushed her crotch against my thigh and mouthed the words, \n\"My pussy.\"\n\n\n",
