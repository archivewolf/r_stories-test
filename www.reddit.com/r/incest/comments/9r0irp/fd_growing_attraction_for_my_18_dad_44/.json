Except that I've had a pretty normal life, I've had a few boyfriend, nothing that lasted more that 6 months. I've had some sexual \"experiences\" with my last boyfriend but I didn't want to go all the way as I wanted to do it with someone that meant a lot to me and that was not the case with him.\n\nNow I'm in college and my mom moved out of my hometown so whenever I come home I stay with my dad. We've always been close, but like normal close. \n\nI really enjoy spending time with him, especially these days. He's started to tease me a lot so I've started to do the same. It's almost like we started to flirt. And I really like it, like really. Like so much I just can't stop thinking about him all day long. We text quite a lot these days. I've almost sent him risky texts when drunk multiple times. I've started to touch myself thinking about him. Best time ever. Everytime when I finish I feel a huge gilt and amptiness. I've decide to finaly have sex to forget about it but both time I was thinking about him. I'm not even turned on by having sex with anyone but my dad..\n\nI was feeling terrible about it but then I found this sub. I've red some stories and it made me feel a bit better about myself. But I feel like everyone has unusual relationship with their daughter/father here and I'm scared that I might be in a different suituation. I don't really know what to do from here.. Have you guys had similar experiences ?",
