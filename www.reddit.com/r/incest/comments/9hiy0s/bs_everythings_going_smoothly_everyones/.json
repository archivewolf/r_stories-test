There's been some \"funny\" stuff and moments of awkwardness, but I'll just get right into that.\n\nI'll start with something that's kinda just funny, at my expense mostly... This was on sunday night I think. I had just taken a shower, my \"brother\" had gone in after me, I was in my room stressing out over whether to try to get into the pet zone, and whether to go full nude, keep the towel or put on something light. Decided to leave the towel on and go snuggle with my boyfriend on the cough, got pretty far into pet zone when my brother came and joined us. Not a problem until I became aware that my whole butt was peaking out and pointing at my brother, lol... But I managed to stay in the pet state of mind and sort of turned around to snuggle with my brother, hiding my butt in the process, lol... And he did what I was hoping, rubbed my head, scratched behind my ears, all the good stuff, he's really acclimating well, lol...\n\nSo then my brother decided to go to bed, and I relaxed a little more with my boyfriend... towel ended up on the floor, hah. But then he had to go to bed early, and I just sat on the couch in a semi-pettish mode for a little while. Until I heard my brother getting up, and I snapped into human mode and for some reason felt the need to run and hide, I don't know why really... Ran to the kitchen, but of course that's where my brother was going, and we had a pretty lengthy conversation while I was standing behind our counter trying to look natural, lol... But it was actually fine! He didn't really act weird or question me, we just talked, and he went to bed. And in hindsight of course that would be okay, and it's just more evidence that our only problem is my own anxiety and nervousness, lol...\n\nAnd actually, there's been a little change in the way things work for us that I didn't expect, but I guess having another person at home would obviously change the dynamics some. A week ago I would've told you being naked as a human doesn't work because I'm not a nudist and that would just be strange, and that wearing clothes as a pet doesn't work because pets don't do that. But in the past couple days I've been very comfortable with just being topless or naked, either just walking from one room to another when putting on clothes would be inconvenient, or when sleeping, or trying things on with my brother which I'll get into in a minute. And while my brother's more reserved with my boyfriend around, he's acting much the same when my boyfriend's out/asleep. I think it's because this used to be very normal with me and my brother, and I'm discovering he hasn't really changed at all in that respect. \n\nOn the other hand, for reasons I can't even figure out I haven't felt comfortable being fully nude in \"pet mode\" in front of my brother yet. But I realized I can get into pet mode just find wearing a little nightie, I guess my logic being there are clothes you can put on dogs to ease anxiety or whatever. So I've been, um, petting it up in a nightie for a couple days, and it's been working perfectly fine for all three of us.\n\nBut onto a slightly more iffy subject... Like I said, been trying on clothes with my brother (whom still wishes to be called my brother as of now). He has a small collection of women's clothing, but he's also been trying on a bunch of my clothes, we're similar enough in sizes, and wearing them around the house. And embarrassingly enough, he's been \"playing dress-up\" with me too, just setting me up in outfits he thinks would look good on me, and I've been humoring him for the most part... Right now I'm actually wearing a skirt and panties from his collection of stuff, lol... (I'm wearing my brother's panties, what a thing to say). But where it starts to get iffy is that I know he's been masturbating consistently ever since he moved in, and now I'm pretty sure he's doing it in my clothes... It's not a gigantic problem and that's why I haven't confronted him about it, but it's just weird... He hasn't, uh, ejaculated in/on my clothes yet so that's fine, but I'll find my panties slightly damp sometimes, not sure whether it's pre-ejaculate or saliva or which would be worse... I don't know, again it's not a problem that's gonna ruin everything, I'm just not sure what to do, or if I should do anything... Another thing is he's occasionally quite loud, and me and my boyfriend figured out that when he's loud he's trying to, uhhh, use his butt to cum, I don't know how to say it any less dirty, haha... That part's mostly just funny, but it's like, dang dude, you wasted no time getting comfortable, lol...\n\nAnyway, that aside we're doing very well. I'm still thankful for everyone who was and is willing to talk with me about all this. \n\n",

As a pet you don't have quite the same control you'd have as a human (I suppose you could bite someone to get a point across but you couldn't talk to them...). The addition of nakedness to that scenario requires a deep level of trust.",
