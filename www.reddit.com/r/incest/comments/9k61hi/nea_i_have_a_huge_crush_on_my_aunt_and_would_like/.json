So since most people probably won't know the story i'm gonna explain it and maybe this time it won't just not go anywhere.\n\nSo me and my aunt have always been very close. I'm gonna be 21 soon and she is 26 (her parents had her very late) so since we are very not far in age we've pretty much always been close. For a while now I have wanted to get even closer. I've had a crush on her for years now and I really doubt she feels the same for me mostly because she has been with the same guy for years now (their relationship is far from going well tho but more on that some other time). Also she has two kids, idk if that part is important but there ya go. We find the same things funny too(also didn't know if that was important so just put it here).At first I was ashamed of it, I was always feeling really bad about all of this but I can't really help it, I still do feel bad about it sometimes.\n\nI said I doubt she feels the same for me but I do have some things to share that might prove otherwise but at the same time I might just be seeing what I want to see. Me and her are very close like I said multiple times, she shares some secrets with me that she shares with no one else sometimes, we talk about her current relationship and the problems with it, I often go help her with the kids because her bf is barely home and whenever we have time to relax I give her massages to help her calm down. Now i'll go more in details about some of these things.\n\n The secrets thing I don't think I need to explain. \n\nTalking about her current relationship, that one is a big one, so her bf is not very good at being a bf/father like at all. I won't get too in details about this but yeah he is pretty bad. Whenever me and my aunt talk about their relationship she doesn't even have positive things to say except that she thinks she should stay with him because that's what love is but besides that she talks shit about him all the time, they argue so often and she just doesn't seem to want to accept that this is not working.\n\nHelping with the kids, now I know this isn't much but like I love these kids almost as if they were my own, i've seen them grow so much and i'd even say i've seen them grow more than their dad has, I go help my aunt with the kids very often because she needs a break sometimes and can't get one because of how her bf is never there to help.\n\nThe massage. Now again I might be seeing things where there is nothing but me and my aunt are very cuddly, we are often sitting right next to each other, sometimes she sits on my lap or she lays her head on me, stuff like that. So sometimes when we have time just me and her to relax I give her back massages. It used to be nothing but the back but lately I've been trying to be more adventurous. Now I just want to say, I have an actual crush on her, not just sexual but I also do think she has a very sexy physical appearance in my opinion. So at first I was only massaging her back but then I started moving on to slowly caressing her neck and after that more oh the forearms, then I slowly started going lower and massaging just above her butt, recently I've been massaging her thighs and I even try to sometimes touch like very close if not her ass. Now at first I thought maybe she would hate this but like recently her brother was messing with her and accidentally touched her ass and she said \"stop thats my ass don't touch that!\" But to me she never said that even if I touch it longer than just half a second. In facts the first time I did this I was super worried about it and she ended up messaging me later saying \"thank you for the massage it was great xoxo\" now that really surprised me because we have like a running joke between us that she never thanks me for the massages and that was the one time she just said thank you without us joking about it first. Again I might just be seeing things where there is nothing but i don't know. What are your thoughts?",
