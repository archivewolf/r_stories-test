I was 28 at the time, and had been living out of state for a few years to gain some real world experience. My mother was 49, and had just married my stepfather a few years earlier when he was diagnosed with stage 5 melanoma cancer.\n\nMy first night home, my mother showed up at my bedside in tears during the early hours of the morning, and after explaining to me how she didn't want to risk any complications from an extramarital affair she propositioned me for sex. My mother and I continued our affair during my visit, and a few days before I left back home my stepfather told me he needed to speak with my privately. I was paranoid he had overheard my mother and I on a few occasions, but it turns out he only wanted to discuss me moving back home to take care of my mother after he was gone.\n\nLater that night when my mother snuck downstairs to my bed, she confessed to me she would always love me as a son, but she was in love with the man I had become. When she asked me to move back home so we could continue our relationship, I confessed to her that I had already promised him I would move back home to take of her when he was gone. With that said, I ended up moving back home weeks later, and my mother and I continued our incestous affair until my stepfather finally lost his battle with cancer.\n\nAfter my stepfather passed, my mother had me move my things into the guest bedroom in the house upstairs for appearances sake, and from that night on we shared her bed when family and friends weren't around. I'm sure when my stepfather asked me to take care of my mother after he was gone, he didn't mean for me to commit incest with my mother, but in a way it felt like I had his blessing. For the next five years my mother and I loved together as a couple in guise of a son caring for his widowed mother. \n",
