She just texted back \"thanks, it probably shouldn't of happened.\"\n\nI told her not to worry about it, we were two consenting adults, it was our business not anybody else's.\n\nShe said \"thanks for being so cool.\" And then said \"it's still a little fucked up because I'm your mom. I'm a shitty mom but still.\"\n\nI said she wasn't a shitty mom she just did the best with what she had and I appreciated everything she did for me, including her and her bf letting me live with them after my dad and stepmom kicked me out.\n\nShe said thanks, I love you. I said I love you too. She said she was upset at herself because her dad did the same thing to her. She said after she turned 18 her dad started sneaking into her room at night and at first it wasn't consensual but eventually she thought it was consensual and she even enjoyed it and she loved she was satisfying her dad when her mom couldn't (her mom was a huge psycho bitch). Then she said \"that's pretty fucked up huh?\"\n\nWell I think it's a little weird but I want to fuck my mom so who am I to judge? I said nah, it's not weird. I said I thought there were lots of little arrangement like that but people just kept their mouth shut about it. And I said I definitely consented to what happened so she was different from her dad. She said \"thanks that makes me feel a lot better.\"\n\nSo she seems to have calmed down a little bit... I thought about asking her when it happens again or if she wanted to do more but didn't want to press my luck, figured she just had a big emotional thing and just let her think about it for awhile.",

Your mom told you her dad had sex with her without consent . . . also known as \"rape\" and \"sexual assault\".  You want to have a consensual sexual relationship with your mom.  It's two different situations.  Saying \"there were lots of little arrangement like that but people just kept their mouth shut about it\" reduces her being sexually abused to a \"little arrangement.\"  And, yes, there are many examples of abuse behind closed doors.  That doesn't make it acceptable, and the way you worded it, you kind of seem to accept the fact your mom was abused and support it.  For her to eventually think it was consensual and enjoy it does not make it right.
