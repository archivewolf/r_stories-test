I don\u2019t know what to do as I\u2019m beyond torn and have no one to talk to or seek advice from.\n\nWithout going into all the details I was on a family cruise this past summer with my sister, her husband, my other sister, my mother, my niece, my nieces friend and my nephew.\n\nOn the 3rd night in of our 10 day 9 night cruise I started having sex with my nephew. No background story needed as this is a confession not a porno. Little bit about the events leading up was he came back to the cabin piss drunk late at night. Was extremely upset about a recent break up. Made a confession of jerking off to the thoughts of me when he was a teenager and most recently earlier that afternoon once we returned from our first port of call.\n\nOne thing led to another and over the span of that night and the next 6 nights and days we fucked like teenage kids.\n\nSince then I can\u2019t stop thinking about it and as much guilt as I feel I want it all the time. No one could ever know, we haven\u2019t flat out talked about it but have been very flirtatious via texts and phone calls. Have dropped hints that it\u2019s something we both can\u2019t stop thinking about and that it was wrong but at the same time the feelings are mutual as to us enjoying those nights together.\n\nI want to just tell him to come over and fuck me like he did on that vacation, but the other part of me is scared. I don\u2019t want to date him, I\u2019m not in love with him, I don\u2019t want a relationship beyond sex with him. I just wanna keep doing what we did, I can\u2019t help it. I\u2019m to a point where it\u2019s all I can think about and all I want.\n\nThe thoughts of him being inside me, him going down on me, seeing the look on his face when I went down on him, I can\u2019t shake it.\n\nIs there anyway to just turn this switch off? How terrible am I? How is it so wrong yet it felt so incredibly good?",
