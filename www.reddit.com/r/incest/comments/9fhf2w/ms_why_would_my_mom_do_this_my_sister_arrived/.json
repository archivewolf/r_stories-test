She's taking tomorrow off too.\nI wanted to go also but we had a big meeting at work and I really had to be there.\n\nWhen I got home after work I could immediately feel the tension in the air. \nThe genuine pleasure in seeing each other was as it always is when we meet but the usual teasing and verbal jousting between us two was not there.\nI asked about her kids and husband and she talked about them for a while but she kept looking me direct in the eyes all the while almost as if she was trying to read something there. \nI was a little uncomfortable about it and was glad when Mom said,\n\"If you get the steaks started they'll be done about the time the rest of the dinner is ready.\"\n\nSo I lit the the grill to heat it up then went to my room to change\u00a0 clothes.\nThen I came back to the kitchen, opened a bottle of wine and poured\u00a0 half a glass for each of us then went out and put the steaks on.\nMy sister Jenny stayed inside with Mom so I sat in a deck chair and sipped some wine wondering what all had transpired between them\u00a0 before I got there.\nOnce Jenny came out to check on the steaks. She just asked how they were doing but again, she stared into my eyes and made me feel uncomfortable. When I turned the steaks she went back inside and I felt relieved.\n\nAt dinner we all put a facade over whatever was up and tried to act like a normal family again.\nAfter the meal I poured another 1/2 glass of wine for everyone and we all went and sat in the living room.\nWe were seated in different chairs in sort of a triangle and I remembered the scene in The Good, Bad and the Ugly where all three of them were watching each other wondering who would draw first and who would be the first target.\nThe tension mounted.\n\nFinally Mom, looking at me said,\n\"I told her everything.\"\n\nI asked, \"Told her everything about what?\"\n\nJenny said, rather sarcastically, \"Oh, don't be so innocent and ridiculous!\"\n\nI was taken aback at that but just shrugged my shoulders and didn't say anything.\n\nThen rather angrily she asked,\u00a0 You can't find a woman to love other than your own mother?\"\n\nI just took it and didn't say a thing but Mom immediatey said, \"JENNY! That's unkind!\"\n\nMy sister backed off and more softly said,\n\"Well, how do you expect me to feel?\"\n\nThen Jenny turned to me and still just as angrily said, \"You did this! You made her do this. She is a good mother, a good woman. She wouldn't have done this with just anyone!\"\n\nI wanted to lash out at her, to shout at her but I just looked at her and said, You're right. She wouldn't have done this with just anyone. She only has one son.\"\n\nJenny screeched at me and said, \"Yeah, why don't you laugh about it. Laugh about breaking up your family!\"\n\nI felt angry now and couldn't help but remember how she would raise a hissy fit when she couldn't get her way with Mom and Dad. \nThen I said, \"That coin has two sides.\"\n\nShe angrily asked, \"What in the hell does that mean?\"\n\nI said, \"Who's causing the rukus in the family now? It's been peaceful and loving around here till this evening.\"\n\nShe said, more softly, You asshole! You're proud of yourself aren't you?\"\n\nMom said, loudly, \"Jennifer!\u00a0 I will Not have that kind of language here.\nHe is not soley to blame. I had my part in it too. If he's an asshole I am one too. And I'm not an asshole!\"\n\nJenny stopped, turned to Mom and just breathed heavily. Her face was the picture of scorn.\nThen she said, Good God mother! How complicit are you in this?\"\n\nMom quickly replied, \"Do you think he forced me against my will?\"\n\nJenny looked aghast, as if only then realizing that this relationship wasn't all one sided and my fault.\nShe said, \"You mean...?\"\n\nMom cut her off and said, \"Yes I mean...\"\n\nJenny let out a soft moan and asked, \"Why?\"\n\nI stepped in asked, \"Why not?\nWould you not let your mother fall in love again? Not let her love whom she will?\"\n\nJenny raised her voice again, looked at Mom and asked, \"Your own son? The child you birthed from your own body??\nHow could you?\"\nThen she looked at me, much more fiercely than she had looked at Mom and asked, \"Your own mother? What in the fuck is wrong with you??\"\n\nI didn't feel anger at her then. I had never heard her talk that way and I began to feel compassion for her. I wanted to console her somehow because I knew this was shocking and painful for her.\nSo I just was silent and took it because I didn't have the words and felt like anything I could have said would seem trite or smug.\nMom was on the verge of tears.\n\nShe looked directly at my sister and said, \"It's okay Honey. It's okay. We're all okay. It's a new, strange, confounding thing for you to be confronted with. We\u00a0 know that. It was for your brother and I too.\"\n\nJenny's eyes opened wider as if she had just then realized it might have been strange for Mom and I too.\nThe conversation went round and round for over an hour. It wasn't a conversation really. It was more of a knock down drag out and I was glad Jen's kids weren't there.\n\nI thought about how her reaction to our relationship was probably typical of how society reacts to an incestuous couple. I saw a long hard road ahead for my mom and I and realized the caution we must use for the rest of our lives. The thoughts were daunting with Jenny using one tactic after another to scare, shame and humiliate Mom and I.\n\nSome of her words did hurt. Some were meant to anger and they did their work.\nI watched Mom's face and color change as she listened to the verbal lashing but I also saw a determination in Mom's face. Determination that wasn't being eroded by repeated attacks from my sister. I thought about how lucky I am to be intimate with this tough, undaunted woman who happened to be my mother.\n\nThen my sister said, \"It's all too revolting.\"\n\nMom quickly but firmly replied, \"Love is not revolting. No love is revolting.\" And the tears came back to her eyes. \n\nWhen Jenny saw them she sighed and said, \"It's late and I'm tired. It's been a long day. Where am I supposed to\nsleep tonight?\"\n\nMom said, \"Everyone will sleep in their old rooms.\"\n\n\nI got up and picked up our wine glasses and brought them to the kitchen. Then I started clearing the table and putting the dishes in the dishwasher.\nMom and Jenny went to her old room and I heard Jenny say,\u00a0 \"It still looks almost like it did when I lived here.\"\u00a0 and her tone of voice was softer.\n\nI could hear them talking in the bedroom so I finished clearing the table. They talked for a long time with the bedroom door closed but not latched. I could not hear what they said but Jenny raised her voice a few times. I brushed my teeth then said loudly down the hall \"Good night all.\" \n\nThey said in unison, \"Good night son\" and \"Good night Tom.\"\n\nThen I shut off my light and used my phone to start writing this. I turned the light on my phone to dim so they would not see it under the door.\nI lay awake for a long time as I missed being with Mom who I've slept with for over 8 months.\nI did not think she will end our relationship but didn't know what will happen to us.\nThen I thought about the saying Grandma had told her when she was young:\n\"Tomorrow is a new day and will reveal another way.\"\nFinally I slept and am finishing this in the morning.\n\n\n\n\n\n",
