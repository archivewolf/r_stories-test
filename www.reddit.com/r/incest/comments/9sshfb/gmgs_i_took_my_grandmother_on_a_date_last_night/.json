She said yes so I told her to dress up in something she felt attractive in. I know she had said that after my grandfather passed that she said she would consider dating again if the right man came along so I wanted to make her feel special.\n\nShe likes these little glass Knick knacks so I got her a little glass red heart as a gift and picked up red roses. I then booked a fancy restaurant to take her to where they have dinner and dancing.\n\nI knocked on her door at around 6:00 and I was blown away. She had her blonde hair half up and a light pink dress, she looked beautiful. I gave her the flowers and she smiled and put them in water then we left.\n\nWe ate dinner and just had normal conversation about life when I decided to give her my gift. She opened it up and took the heart out and said \u201cOh I love it but what\u2019s the occasion?\u201d\n\nI just told her that I wanted her to know I loved her. She blushed and a slow song came on so I asked her to dance. When she accepted, I put my hands around her waist and she put her arms around my neck. We danced for a little bit but I wanted to stay discrete in case anyone saw us. Now when we got home, it was a different story.\n\nI walked her to her door and she thanked me for dinner and her gift. I took her hand and kissed it and said \u201cYou looked beautiful tonight \u201c\n\nShe just blushed and hugged me saying, \u201cYou sure know how to make a woman feel special \u201c \n\nNow this is what caught me off guard, \u201cShe pulled back and pecked my lips with hers. It wasn\u2019t long but it wasn\u2019t short either. I haven\u2019t seen her since. Maybe I should talk to her about it when I do",
