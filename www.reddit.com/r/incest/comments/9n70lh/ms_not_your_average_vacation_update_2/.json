I slept in a little today and was feeling kind of lazy, so I kind of just replied to people here, read some advice and just kept recollecting what happened yesterday.  I made up my mind.  I was going to eat the shit out of my Mom.  Thanks for everyone for the advice and comments.\n\n\nAnyway, I eventually rolled out of bed and just joined everyone for breakfast.  I\u2019m normally the talkative one in my family, but I was dead quiet during breakfast.  My siblings were making some small talk about their snorkeling trip, when my Mom asked me:\n\n\n\u201cSo what did you get up to dear?\u201d With a huge smirk on her face.\n\n\nI froze for a second and tried to come up with something witty.\n\n\n\u201cI uhh, made a drink for this girl I met at the bar.  She really seemed to like it because she finished all of it.  Not a drop was left.\u201d\n\n\nShe said: \u201cOh?  What was in the drink?\u201d\n\n\nMe: \u201cOh you know, just my personal homemade mix.  I don\u2019t give it to just anyone.\u201d\n\nHer: \u201cWell maybe you could make some for me, if she liked it that much, it must have been really good!\u201d\n\n\nI think my face was turning red, but who could really tell through my savage sun burns.  Images from last night flashed through my head and I got a savage boner.  I spent a whole $1.00 USD to send a text to my Mom saying \u201cI\u2019ve got a surprise for you tonight.\u201d  She replied with \u201cNot until the day at sea honey ;)\u201d  I replied \u201cIt\u2019s something else  ;) ;)\u201d\n\n\nThe rest of the day went by without anything really happening.  We went to the island and decided to stay around the more commercial area, so we bought some local food for lunch, shopped around for sunglasses, clothing, unique snacks, etc.  I ran ahead of everyone when I saw a lingerie store.  I frantically searched the store for a black thong because my Mom just has the finest ass.  The clerk must have thought I was crazy or something.  Anyway, I found her size and bought it quickly and stuffed it into my bag.  I saw a sex shop and almost went in but I chickened out and continued browsing around other stores.\n\n\nDinner time rolled around quickly and we just had a normal dinner with the family.  There was a party going on at the top deck, so all of us joined in on the festivities.  It was fun.  Lots of dancing and more food.  I didn\u2019t do anything with my Mom here because I wasn\u2019t really sure how open we were going to be about what we were doing.\n\n\nAnyway, after we got tired of dancing, my siblings met up with some friends they made earlier on the cruise for some drinks and a movie.  They asked if I wanted to join and I told them I\u2019d catch up with them after the first movie.  I whispered into my Mom\u2019s ear \u201csurprise time\u201d.  Her eyes just shot right at me and she skipped over to me as we went over to her room.\n\n\nOnce we were in her room I slowly began to take her dress off, if such a thing were possible.  Two straps around the shoulders and she was in her under garments.  I lead her to the bed and gently pushed her down onto her back.  She said \u201cNow now, you remember was I said...\u201d I replied \u201cOf course\u201d.  She smiled as I slowly pulled off her underwear with my teeth.  I began to kiss her inner thighs and she release and insanely hot \u201cooooh\u201d.  At that time I removed her bra with one hand and begun to play with her nipples.  She made more moaning sounds and grab at my hair.\n\n\nI don\u2019t know how I had the self control that I did tonight, but here I am writing.  As I kissed her inner thighs and played with her boobs, I began to move my mouth down to her pussy.  It was perfectly shaved.  I slowly brought my tongue out and started to run it up and down her clit.  I did the first run by slowly then just went to town.  I won\u2019t type out to many details because I\u2019m honestly not that great at this whole eating out thing.  Whatever I did seemed to work because of all of her moaning, but man, I felt like I had no idea what I was doing.  She said that she didn\u2019t orgasm, but it was ok and that I will get better in time.  She was happy with my little surprise for her and I told her I\u2019d eat her out whenever she wanted me to.\n\n\nAfter she told me that I decided to do something I was good at and that\u2019s fingering.  After I pulled my face away from her pussy I almost immediately shoved two fingers in.  Her eyes widened with surprise and she said that I didn\u2019t have to, but I really really wanted to make her orgasm.  I shot her a massive grin in response and just went to town with my fingers.  I\u2019m never 100% sure I know if I\u2019m hitting a females\u2019 gspot, but I think I found hers and just went ham on it.  She moaned so damn loud I think I could have jizzed from that alone.  Her nails dug into my arms as my fingers went in and out of her and loved every second of it.  Eventually she released this kind of strange giggle, which almost made me stop, but I kept going.  Shortly after the giggle she put up a hand like a stop sign so I stopped.\n\nPanting heavily and glazed with sweat she told me that she giggled a bit when she orgasms.  I smiled and planted a kiss right on her lips and we began to make out a bit.  The feeling was a bit foreign to me, I don\u2019t know how these sexual acts weren\u2019t, but a kiss was, but here we are.  I brushed it off and continued to kiss her.  \n\n\nSince both of us were super sweaty we tried to be sexy and shower together, but cruise ship showers are so damn small, so we aborted that idea.  After we finished cleaning up, I asked my Mom if she enjoyed the night and she told me that she did.  She told me she was off to bed so I left and now I\u2019m writing this in my room.  I\u2019ll probably go catch a bit of the second movie before I go to sleep.\n\n\nTomorrow is a day at sea, so maybe that\u2019s the day it will happen!\n\n\nPS: Yes, I still have the sexy underwear.  I honestly forgot to give it to her tonight.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
