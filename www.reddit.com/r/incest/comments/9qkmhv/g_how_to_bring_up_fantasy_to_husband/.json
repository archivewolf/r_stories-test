Me (F 30) and my husband (M 44) have been together for 10 years, and we still have a great sex life. We're both pretty kinky and have never really had something either of us really didn't want to do, but aside from a lot of dirty talk we've never done the whole roleplay thing. I'll call him Daddy and he'll call me his little girl etc. but when it comes to full blown roleplay I think we both get a little self conscious, oddly enough :P The other night though we were both stoned and started having some pretty intense dirty sex, and went through the usual dirty talk, but then it went somewhere totally new. I can't remember exactly how it started but somehow we got to him telling a really hot erotic story he'd read as a kid about 2 friends, but after we were done he said it was really about step siblings. Then he started saying something like if I was his little step sister he'd never be able to leave me alone, and me sneaking in his room at night and we got pretty into it and ended up having sex again. It was seriously some of the hottest sex I've ever had. I've kind of always secretly had a little bit of an incest fetish, (no I do not want to actually fuck my actual brother or Dad) but I never thought I'd be as into as I was, or that he'd be into it at all. My whole thing is though I really want to do it again. Or even go one step further and surprise him by roleplaying me sneaking into his room (sometimes he sleeps in the guest room if he's snoring super bad) etc, buuuut I'm really shy when it comes to directly asking for what I want when it's something outside the norm :/ I swear I'm like a 13 year old girl, blushing and having a hard time getting the words out, which is beyond ridiculous for the insane sex drive and kinks I have but true haha. I know he's the one who started talking like that, but I dunno if it was just some random talk that seemed kind of hot in the moment but he wouldn't be into actually acting it out. I don't really think he'd judge me for it whatever his feelings are, but I just don't know how to even bring it up. Any advice on how to go about it?",
