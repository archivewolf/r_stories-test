Love him to death but he will have trouble in life if my parents ever decide to let him support himself.\n\nI am 100% sure I am the only girl he has seen naked. It isn't just a flash of tits as I may have led people to believe. He is happy just to have me answer his questions about my body or even acknowledging his compliment.\n\nFor example this morning I was a bit late getting ready and I told him that I would wear his shirt if he let me into the bathroom with him so I could do my makeup. I don't bully him like I guess some other girls would do to a brother that is younger.\n\nI went into his room and even though he didn't agree to it I showed him just how I wore it. Tied tight with the knot basically under my breasts with my stomach sucked in for effect. He opened the door and I got my make up done. With an audience but I am used that kind of attention from him.\n\nI do sometimes show him tits for something I really need done that I absolutely need but can't bother to do myself. I have been trying to avoid it though after he told our cousin about these events.\n\nI don't let him touch me I just don't he can gawk, stand right up to me to take a good look but not touch me or anything like that and he has always been super respectful after I made that clear to him who knows when but I am glad for that.\n\nI have never felt like I am degrading myself to him either and I never feel icky about it because well its just him. \n\nNothing like what my uncle makes me feel like about my body that is for sure. I never had to warn my brother or feel unsafe or even nervous about a certain situation I am in either naked or wearing my underwear around it is just something we both get something from.\n\nWhen I wore more cheeky clothes like bikinis and sleepwear he was the first I let see. Something that helped me build a sort of confidence about something that felt so scary which is weird thinking back because people who know me now know that I could sit around the hot dog stand in my thong in front of dozens of strangers without a sweat just another summer afternoon. Would never tell him that but those years built my comfort with wearing them.\n\nBut there was a time I had to ask him how \"sexy this looked\" or asked him not to tell our parents but I wanted to \"practice wearing these for someone in front of another person\" we have that kind of relationship. Nothing that meets incest for me but those that ask I just wanted to explain",
