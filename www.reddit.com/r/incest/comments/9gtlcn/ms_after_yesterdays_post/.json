So I went to my room and stayed there. I heard the house door closing and she went out, she then came back and went straight to her room, so I decides it's time. \n\nI walked to her room, knocked on her door and asked if I can come in and she said yes. I walked in, she was sitting on her bed so I sat next to her and we both looked at the floor. Then she just said \"this can't happen again without protection\". I asked if she wanted to do it again and she got closer to me, held my head, and kissed me. It was sweet and slow, I knew that we weren't going to fuck right at that moment again so I kept it cool. \n\nShe lied there and I got on her, kissing her while I'm touching her breasts. Then I raised her shirt and took it off, and she took her bra herself. Finally I started rubbing her outside of her pants and she reminded me of what she said. I told her I just wanted to see it, so she helped me lower her pants and panties. I spread her legs up and away from her and got between them. I started touching her, exploring. She definitely was wet. Remember she just came from outside and so she had this nice musky scent that was really intoxicating. \n\nIt wasn't my first time getting upclose with a pussy but I just really wanted to take my time with it... Touching it all over, getting to see all of it. Then I just had to taste her, so at first I gave her a quick lick just to see how she would react and I figured she's liking it, so I licked her more, getting my tongue in her pussy while rubbing her clit with my thumb,eventually reaching her clit with my tongue and that's where she said I need to stop. Then she just turned to the side and sat on the bed again like when we started. \n\nI sat up too and said I know she needs relief, I held her head toward me like she did and kissed her, put her leg over my lap and bringing my hand to her pussy again, rubbing her clit. She moaned really hard into my mouth but again she stopped me and said I need to go. I got up and started jacking off in front of her, using my very wet and sticky hands. I came over her face and breasts and she just sat there accepting it. I looked at her just sitting there, with my cum all over her and I started to feel kinda guilty and I asked if she was ok, I waited for an answer that didn't come and eventually went to my room.\n\nHaven't seen her since, she's at work now, we'll see how tonight goes.

No . . . not only was it disrespectful to her boundaries, but it was also kind of demeaning.  It is almost humiliating in a way.  You are demonstrating to her that even though she wants some distance, you are still going to get off around her and, almost literally, mark her as a sexual object.  And this after you chose to ignore her desire to refrain from sexual contact by moving your hand fast enough to touch her vagina, knowing full well she would stop you.  You knew that she did not want you to touch her there, and proceeded to force your hands quick enough so she couldn't resist.  Was that respectful of her wishes?  You got what you wanted, and maybe she enjoyed the sex, but she clearly has reservations and you are just pushing the boundary to gratify yourself.  My suggestion?  Start following her lead.  She may be feeling regret for actions you insisted upon, so you started this.  Don't make it worse.",

After she continually rejected your sexual advances?  No . . . not only was it disrespectful to her boundaries, but it was also kind of demeaning.  It is almost humiliating in a way.  You are demonstrating to her that even though she wants some distance, you are still going to get off around her and, almost literally, mark her as a sexual object.  And this after you chose to ignore her desire to refrain from sexual contact by moving your hand fast enough to touch her vagina, knowing full well she would stop you.  You knew that she did not want you to touch her there, and proceeded to force your hands quick enough so she couldn&amp;#39;t resist.  Was that respectful of her wishes?  You got what you wanted, and maybe she enjoyed the sex, but she clearly has reservations and you are just pushing the boundary to gratify yourself.  My suggestion?  Start following her lead.  She may be feeling regret for actions you insisted upon, so you started this.  Don&amp;#39;t make it worse.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
