I find out that my last post was removed for \"Glorifying Rape\" the fact that my post was removed means absolutely nothing to me fuck that post honestly. I come here to share my life because just as many creeps and pervs I have interacting with me on here I have ran into and met some on the nicest most non judgemental people on this earth. I also get something out of this for myself, as well as a lot of these post may not state but they are so obviously fake but that is fine people with an Incest fetish need those post. Imagination is some of the best porn ever and for most of my childhood pre-Internet that is all we had so these post real or not help alot of people feel better and give them the relief that they need. \n\n   I however despite what some people have accused me of I am very very much real and each and everything I share is what has happened in my life. Sure I may add adjectives to make it a better read simply because real life is not a romance novel and things usually just happen plus nobody and I mean NOBODY can remember a conversation word for word even if it happened ten minutes before writing about it. All this being said I am in a relationship with my sister, my sister who I share the same piece of shit Mother with and the same mystery man of a father with, we are lucky enough to have our little brother be apart of our lives here recently who we both love very much but the future with someone who is a young adult just starting their life is so much more of an unknown so I do know that one way or another he will for ever be in our lives that is for certain. Lindsay and I have been in a relationship of some sort our entire lives together and more importantly a Romantic relationship for the past 7 years maybe I honestly don't know the exact amount of years anymore. My point here is that what she and I do has never and I mean NEVER ever been non consensual.\n\n   \n\n   When two adults are in a relationship sex is very much a part of it and in our life it is a VERY BIG part of it as you may have picked up on by reading my post. As a nurse for the past decade plus I have administered more rape kits than I care to count or remember. I am lucky enough as a women in this current world we live in to have made it as long as I have and not encountered a sexual assault as I know it happens to way too many little boys and girls as well as it does grown women. I have not nor will I EVER GLORIFY RAPE in any way and if me waking my love up by initiating sex is glorifying it in the minds of the people that have the power to dish out punishments then maybe this isn't the place for me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   To all the people who I have made relationships with I am sorry but I am not going to be posting here anymore and if there are any real people out there who truly want help on their relationships shunned by society message me and I can give you a way to contact me. This is a place for people of like minded or people who live the same looked down on lifestyles. Before I get any comments about this yes I know they have a job to do and I do agree that there needs to be people doing said job but not in any way was my post glorifying anything other than good morning sex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   Thank you for being here for me when you were but as everything else in life seems to piss me the fuck off when I need it the most,\n\nXOXO Lizzy  ",
