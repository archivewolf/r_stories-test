She is single, been divorced from my dad for seven years.\n\nI used to masturbate thinking about her as a kid but recently my attraction to her was restarted with a few things.\n\nWe were going to my cousin's high school graduation in June and we were about to walk out the door when she saw the dress shirt I had on had a stain on it. She sent me back upstairs to change and I didn't have any like similar shirts and she came in when I was shirtless. I was a little embarrassed and was like \"mom!\" and she blushed and said something like \"wow, you have like the body of a man now.\" I told her not to be weird and she said sorry, I guess that's not something you want to hear from your mom.\n\nThen over the summer at a family party my uncle kept saying it was \"so weird\" the time my mom and I spend together. We don't really like do everything together but we do go on trips and stuff alone and we have since my parents got divorced. My uncle kept saying that was \"so weird\" I still wanted to live with my mom and he said I needed some \"male influence\" and suggested I live with him and my aunt and cousins for a year. He didn't accuse us of incest or anything but that plus the \"body of a man\" comment really got my attraction of mom going again.\n\nSo I've been trying to tease and flirt with her a little, see if she bites. Two episodes, I've been walking around in just gym shorts slid down low below my waist or just black boxer-briefs and she definitely blushed and looks away, one time she told me to \"get my butt out of here and get clothes on\". I asked if she was looking at my butt and she said it was hard to miss it.\n\nSecond time, I was wearing some Old Spice deodorant that a female friend picked out for me and I was wearing it around my mom wearing just gym shorts and she stopped and said I smelled great and she like shoved her head into my arm pit, then she looked at me and like bit her lower lip. She asked where I got it and I said a friend bought it for me (long story).\n\nFinal sign (I was trying to compliment her more) I was laying on the couch one morning when my mom was leaving to go to work, she was wearing a tight white blouse and a black skirt and she said she was leaving. I said damn mom, looking good. She thanked me. I asked if guys at work hit on her and she blushed and said no. I said they probably are intimidated by her and she smiled and asked where I learned to be such a flirt. I said it came naturally and she asked if I flirted with girls my own age like this. I said nah, I liked older women. She blushed and said I was trouble today and left.\n\nThose are my best moments/signs. Do you think she's interested, do you think I have a chance? I don't know how to progress it any further without taking risks. Please don't tell me to barge into the bathroom while she's showering or show her my dick or something, I don't think those ever work.\n\nFor those curious, she's about 5'4, straight black hair, brown eyes, big tits, big ass, little bit of a tummy. More thick than fat tho.",
