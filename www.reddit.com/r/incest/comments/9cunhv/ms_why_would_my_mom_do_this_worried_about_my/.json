The gist of the call was that my sister said she had made her flight reservation and would be coming out to visit for a few days in mid September.  We knew she was coming at some point, just not when.\n\nMom was happy and talked about it afterwards but is disappointed that sis (Jenny) can't bring her kids this time.\nI was happy too of course but my mind immediately went to the last time my sister and I talked/texted and she was being a little too inquisitive about how Mom and I were getting along.\nWhen I mentioned that to Mom a cloud passed over her face and she got real serious and said, \n\n\"Oh yeah, you're right. She hasn't said a thing about it to me since.\"\n\nThen she said, \"It's all been so happy here since then that I've put all that entirely out of my mind. What do you think we should do?\"\n\nThat lead to an hour long conversation between us and we tried to view the possibilities from every angle.\nI said, \"Maybe the reason she's not bringing the kids is she's expecting a knock down, drag out fight.\"\n\nMom said, \"Oh God! I hope not.\"\n\nThroughout the conversation I kept going back to the fact that she had raised us to be open minded about things and I told her my sister would probably accept it as a fait accompli.\n\nMom wasnt so sure and kept thinking about it in terms of having to having to make a choice between her children.\n\"What will we do if she gives us an ultimatum? Like, stop what's going on between us or she will disown us.\"\n\nI asked, \"How could she make us stop?\nHow could she even know or verify if we stop or don't stop? She lives so far away.\"\nThen I asked, \"Are you willing to end this for her sake? Would you end it for anyone?  I didn't give her an opportunity to answer then added, \"I don't think I would end this with you for anyone, save for a judge who put me in jail for it.\"\n\nShe gave me a rather pitious smile and said, \"Thanks.  I know you love me but what will we do?\"\n\nI went back to comparing interfamilial love relationships to interracial and gay relationships and asked, \"Who has the right to tell us who we can love and how we can love them?\"\n\nShe said, \"You're preaching to the choir.\nBut with things like this you can't appeal to the rational mind as the objections are not rational.\nThey are emotional. Emotional reactions to a thing one finds objectionable can be the most destructive.\"\n\nShe was So right and I had nothing to say to that so I repeated my earlier thoughts that she had raised the two of us to be open  minded. My sister might make a fuss about it but ultimately, what could she do?\n\"I can't belive she would ever report us or anything like that.\"\n\nMom said, No. I know she wouldn't do that but she could stop seeing us and not let me see my grand kids any more.\nI just can't make a choice between my children.\"\n\nI said, So would you lie to her?\"\n\n\"NO! I will not lie to her about this or anything else.\" Then she started to cry.\n\nI said, \"Let's not talk about this anymore tonight. Let's just go to bed and sleep on it. We can't do anything now anyway.\"\n\nShe stopped sniffling and said, \"You're right. It's late anyway.\"\nThen she said, \"Your grandma would always say, \"Tomorrow is another day and will reveal another way.\"\n\nWe went to bed and I spooned with her and kissed the back of her neck and side of her face.\nWe did not talk. She was restless.\nAt last she turned over and kissed me and said, \"Good night.\n\nThen she turned back over and snuggled her backside into me.\nI held her to me and fell asleep soon after.",
