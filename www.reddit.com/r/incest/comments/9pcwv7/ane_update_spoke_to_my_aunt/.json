She said she went to North Dakota for work because her friend told her about a job. I said that was total bullshit and she was running and demanded to know where she was but she stuck to that story. She then just said \"does anybody know?\"\n\nI said no nobody knows. I said I didn't remember much of it but I liked it and I thought she was sexy as hell and I had imagined we could keep something on the downlow if she hadn't ran off.\n\nShe said she enjoyed it too but then completely twisted it around. She said I had come on to her, gotten her drunk, and seduced her which is total bullshit because I'm not even 21 and I was a virgin. But then she said we can't tell anyone because we'd both be in trouble.\n\nI said I wasn't a kid I wasn't going to tell anyone. I asked when she was coming back and she said she didn't know. She said she's going to lay low and look for this job. I asked if there was another man involved and she got really condescending and said something like \"being clingy and insecure isn't attractive to women, OP\" which made me feel like a kid and made me feel like shit so I hung up on her.\n\nI don't buy her story that she heard about a job from a friend across the country and took off leaving all her clothes and furniture here without warning but whatever. Honestly the way she's handled all this has made me feel abused. I didn't think it was rape when it happened but now honestly the way she has acted like she did something wrong makes me feel like I was violated more than what I remember actually happening.",
