So getting to see any family from my fathers side was strange. So when my dads side of the family would have family reunions I would jump on the chance to go. These we average reunions to bring all the fam together as most family\u2019s do. I would always hangout with my cousin, let\u2019s call her Jenna for privacy sake. Purely innocent family hangouts, jumping on trampolines, shooting marshmallow guns, and riding around in buggies and such. After this reunion I wouldn\u2019t see Jenna again due to the time spent with my father purely spent with him and immediate family.\n\nAbout 4 years later I move to the south for a few years. During that time I have no communication with anyone from my dads side of the family except for my dad. Also during my time in Florida I met my (at the time SO). I live in Florida until just after my 18th birthday in May. I guess you could easily assume my ma\u2019s family and I moved back home. \n\nThis is when and where our events start. When we first moved back home I was pretty sad. Back in Florida I would spend everyday with my gf and became emotionally as well as physically attached to her being around. So moving back across the country put a hefty damper on my mood to say the least. It had been about a week or so after the move and I get a call from an unknown number. I answer it and to my surprise it\u2019s my cousin Jenna who up until now I had completely forgot about. We talked on the phone for about an hour about how we were both adults now and all the usual bs. A perfectly normal phone call, but it\u2019s what happened after that first peaked my attraction for her. \n\nAbout an hour after the call she started texting me saying, how much she missed her big cousin and how lonely she\u2019s been since I\u2019ve been gone. She then sent me a message that said \n\u201cHere\u2019s a picture of your pretty cousin in her cheerleader uniform\u201d\nThat message alone sent me down the river of lust. But I was still with my gf at the time so I replied with some lame ass comment like oh very cool or something.\n\nA couple weeks later she came over to hangout, it was our first time getting to see each other after the reunion years ago. I had since become taller (about 6\u201d3\u2019) and thin but fit, she is now short, blonde hair, curvy but nowhere near overweight. She looked beautiful. Her and I were hanging out and she was really intrigued with my gf and I\u2019s bearded dragon that I got in Florida. She wanted to hold him and kept pestering me until I caved in. I pulled diablo out and set him on Jenna\u2019s shoulder and she giggled then sat down on my couch. I sat down at the opposite end of the couch. She scoots down and places her feet directly in my lap. I place my hand on her ankle and that\u2019s how we stay for a while. Nothing else happens then.\n\nIt\u2019s now been a few months since then. We\u2019re both 19 now. We\u2019re both now single as well. Not much has happened except for texts and Snapchat\u2019s in the months since the last event. Until early last month that is. I know have my own little place and she wanted to come over. I was all for it but she said she\u2019d have to come over later because of her schedule. I told her that\u2019s fine and to come over at 9pm. She came over and put on a movie on my pc. We then just sat on my bed and talked while the movie played. We talked about stupid shit for a bit, then she started talking about her sexual life. Telling me about her ex\u2019s and such. After a little bit she smiled at me and said\n\u201cThis is strange talking to you about this kinda stuff\u201d\nI say \u201cyeah it is but it\u2019s kinda nice\u201d\nShe smiles and agrees with me before laying down on my bed. The movie finished and I ask her what\u2019s the plan for the rest of the night. She said she better leave and I didn\u2019t argue with that due to work the next morning. \n\nA couple weeks later and she wants to come over again. This time she gets to my place at around 6pm. She puts on another movie, It was Texas chain saw massacre, and immediately goes to my bed and lays down. I follow suit and lay down next to her but make sure not to be to close. A couple times throughout the movie she see a funny video on face book and invites me to come watch it with her. I would slide my hand over her right stomach and slide my body up along hers only to rest my face on her breasts to watch said video. That happened a few times. Movie ends and she says she has to go. \n\nFast forward a week and I\u2019m here writing this. Am I seeing this for too much? Any advice on the matter is appreciated. This my first post on reddit and made a second account just for this, but I have been a r/incest sub since I moved back home. Alright that\u2019s enough from me. \n\nThank you.",
