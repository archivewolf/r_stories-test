I considered Incest Relationships but I'm not sure how explicit about things I can get there, so I'm here just to be safe I guess. I apologize if I sound really awkward and weird, because I feel kinda awkward and weird here, lol.\n\nSo I need to explain my relationships with my brother and my boyfriend for this to make sense. Me and my brother are very very close, always have been for the most part. I think we trust each other with our lives, at least I trust him with mine. Growing up we were both, y'know, curious and horny, we'd go on websites we weren't supposed to together and discovered things about ourselves, and show off a little to each other. It didn't really lead to anything like incest though, instead we just became very comfortable in our skin around each other, very comfortable and willing to say, change together, use the bathroom at the same time, hit up a nude beach together a few times, lol. I don't really let him see anything down low anymore but there's no problem being topless with him, it's just not an issue. Hope this isn't too long a paragraph, just trying to make it clear what kind of relationship we have.\n\nThen there's my long-term boyfriend, or practical fiance I guess, we're getting married once it makes sense money wise. He's amazing, 100% my soul mate, I could say good things about him all day but I'll just skip to the important parts. This is more awkward to admit than I expected, but I'm kind of a human pet at home. Like, the vast majority of the time I'm naked, not speaking, not standing on two legs, eating and drinking with bowls or plates on the floor, sometimes I'll put on fake dog/cat ears or use an anal plug with a tail, I typically sleep curled up at my boyfriend's feet, or in a cage if he's not home. And we have sex pretty much whenever he wants, lol (Or when I want, but yeah). And this isn't something my boyfriend forced me into or something, I'm definitely the more dominant one in fact. He won't beat me with a newspaper if he catches me clothed, sitting at the table, eating with a fork and drinking out of a cup, and I start telling him about my day at work or something, lol. I'd say we're still perfectly normal like that maybe 25% of the time. And I'm his pet the other 75% because it just works for us, I guess. It's only partly a fetish thing too, I just feel comfortable doing it, it makes me happy. I can't tell you exactly why I'm like this because I don't know for sure, lol.\n\nSo anyway, the problem is that we agreed to let my brother move in with us indefinitely, for a number of reasons. He's 100% welcome here, I love him to death and he's friends with my boyfriend, there should be no problem. I just don't know how to break the news of my home life to him, or if I should at all. And I don't really want to just stop being my boyfriend's pet, but I'm wondering if I should force myself to stop. Like, he's pretty young, barely 18, I don't know what seeing me like this will do to him, or what it will do to his image of me. Even if me roaming around naked doesn't phase him, he'll see me having sex at some point, I can almost guarantee it. I'm not opposed to the idea, in fact I'd like to be able to trust him enough to watch. I just don't know what it'll do to him, you know?\n\nI can feel and see myself getting too stressed out so I think I should stop here and just wait for any advice, lol. I guess to shorten things, I want to keep living my life as is in front of my brother but I don't know if it's right or if he'll be okay with it. So... help me, lol.

Shy of abuse, I don't think any reasonable person here will judge you for your kinks.\n\nI think the comment you will get the most is some form of \"Just sit down and talk to him.\" Unfortunately that's the only correct answer. As for *how* to broach the subject, I'd suggest just sitting him down and saying \"Hey I want you to know before you move in that my boyfriend and I have this cool lifestyle thing that makes us really happy\" and go from there. If he's as chill as he sounds, I don't think he'd mind. Obviously clear this with your boyfriend beforehand.\n\n&gt; Even if me roaming around naked doesn't phase him, he'll see me having sex at some point, I can almost guarantee it. I'm not opposed to the idea, in fact I'd like to be able to trust him enough to watch.\n\nI'd cross that bridge only when it's time. Mention it to your BF obviously, but don't lead with it.",

How would you feel if he got involved?  Not necessarily sexually but part of the RP?  How would you feel if it progressed beyond that?  Once you have these answers for yourself you need to talk to your BF about how he might feel about those decisions.

It will be a less potentially condescending/emotional/judgemental environment if you explaining to him and showing him as a photographer/model relationship. (You wouldn&amp;#39;t need to be having sex you could just do photo/videos of the non hardcore side.)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
