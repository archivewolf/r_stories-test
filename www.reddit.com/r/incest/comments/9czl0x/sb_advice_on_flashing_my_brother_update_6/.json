Sorry for being silent so long, I had something written up (which I lost now anyway) but then came exam phase in which I had to cram like there\u2019s no tomorrow, and then I went on vacation for two weeks. I\u2019ve been back for a little more than two weeks so lets get going on what happened so far.\n\nOver the exam time, I actually interacted very little with my little brother Danny. He knows the drill, and I really needed to get good grades on those last few exams of mine. Where we live it got extremely hot (for our standards), 30\u00b0C and more, so I (and we all in the house) dressed pretty lightly but not in an exciting way. Two days after my last exam I went on vacation with two friends of mine, and now I\u2019m back home. Danny currently has summer vacation.\n\nWhen I got home it was still insanely hot, 33\u00b0C some days. During the study phase I already got used to dressing in something along the line of a loose and long tanktop which covers some of my butt at least and basic panties or very short shorts with nothing underneath but snug so nothing shows accidentally. Basically stuff I\u2019d be comfortable with my parents seeing me in, and due to the heat nobody objected or bat an eye. I noticed Danny looking sometimes since I was back home, and I really enjoyed the attention I got from him. We continued hanging out like before my exam phase and mostly watched videos or movies together occasionally and just chit-chatted. We also got around to going to the pool together finally and I could wear my sexy new bikini that day, which was just an enjoyable pool day nothing crazy happened.\n\nLast week our parents went to visit friends in another country so we had the house for ourselves from Friday to Monday. I went out with a friend on Friday and coming home I decided to hang out with Danny, but he had a friend over so I let them play. On Saturday we went grocery shopping together in the morning and planned on cooking lunch together. Being alone with Danny for the first time in a while I felt kind of frisky and with the heat and all I had a good excuse to take off some clothes. I went up to my room and got rid of my jeans shorts which I wore to go shopping, and got rid of my bra as well, leaving me in just a tanktop and a sporty white thong I had on underneath. The past days I haven\u2019t been wearing much more around the house, but the thong was a step up and kind of a totally different feeling of exposure to me compared to regular plain panties. When I came back down to the kitchen and my brother saw me I saw him look at my crotch briefly but back to me and then quickly back to what he was doing. \u201cIt\u2019s soo hot\u2026\u201d I tried to casually rationalize me having undressed. I remember I felt kind of embarrassed and also silly for walking around in a thong in front of my brother, but Danny didn\u2019t really say anything and he kinda saw lots of my butt because of my brazilian-cut bikini already anyway. We started preparing the food. Wearing the thong with a not-too-long tanktop exposed my butt a little, and my little brother had chances looking with me going around the kitchen working, but I\u2019m still not really sure if he\u2019s into butts to begin with. Nothing wild happened of course so we cleaned things up after eating and went to do things. \n\nAfter dinner we talked a little about various things and then went upstairs to our rooms. The conversation just kept going and I casually followed Danny into his room while talking, where I sat down on his bed and he sat down on his desk chair. We eventually decided on watching a longer youtube video together. We sat on the bed next to each other and I actually just had a good time with the funny videos, I grew a liking to what Danny watches on Youtube. Some time in he suddenly asked me \"do you maybe want a massage?\" which surprised me a little, but I'm not one to turn down a massage so I happily agreed. \"Your legs, right?\" Danny asked me. He seemed very motivated, haha. I thought a little bit and decided I wanted a back massage. I laid down on my belly on the length of his bed, while my little brother remained to my side, he seemed a little unsure of what to do. \"You can sit on my butt, it's easier like that\" I reassured him. He obliged, and I felt him straddle my butt (he is surprisingly heavy). \n\nFor a short while I was curious if he was going to make me take off my tanktop but of course he didn't, he just massaged me through it. The way his bed was positioned we had to both turn to the side to watch the video. \"A little firmer, Danny\" I guided him. After that, the massage felt great. While him massaging me felt relaxing, him touching me felt moreso exciting, especially closer to the sides of my back. I moaned regularly when it felt especially good, and relaxed a lot. Danny seemed to be working his way down my back, and he alternated in different sometimes more tickling than massaging techniques like poking my back with his fingertips. \"I'll get off you for the lower back\" he said and got off me. I spread my legs a little in case he wanted to sit directly behind me, but he stayed to my side and continued massaging my lower back, near my hips. The closer he came to my butt, the more excited I got in anticipation. To my disappointment he just stopped short of my thong and went back up my back, but didn't straddle me again.\n\n\"That was really good already. Would it be too much if I asked you to get my legs too, please?\" I asked Danny kindly because I didn't want him to stop. \"Sure Sis\" he replied. \"But you really don't have to if you rather don't\" I checked back. \"No no, it's fine. I like massaging you\" Danny said which made me happy. \"I'll massage you later too if you want\" I offered back to which he just made an acknowledging sound. Overall, we were rather quiet during the massage and just listened to the video. Danny sat way behind me so to start rubbing my feet. I became very aware of the fact that I was wearing a thong, and I wasn't really sure what he could or couldn't see from back there. He didn't make any comment though and just started kneading and pressing my soles which felt incredible. Danny slowly worked his way up from my calves to my thighs, and as he scooted closer I had to spread my legs a little more so he could sit behind me. As his hands came closer and closer to my crotch, along my thighs, with the sensation of the massage, I got aroused quite some. Again, his hands came very close to my pussy and butt but never touched, Danny seemed to be very careful about that. The way he touched me was kind of \"unrefined\", I can't think of a better word. But maybe also innocent as in he just thinks I have sore muscles is why I need a massage. But that in return turned me on like crazy, I got really tingly about the \"innocent\" situation. When he kneaded the place where my legs and butt connect, I said \"oh, this spot is really good. Do that one more\". It wasn't that special actually, but it was as close to my butt as he got and maybe I could get him to do more. It totally made no sense but I was a little horny and tried to push it. He put his fingers on the spot I meant and asked \"here?\" to which I friskily said \" a little higher\", and I felt Danny slide his hands up and he had them basically on the bottom end of my butt already.\"Here??\" -  \"Yes, that's the spot. I think I'm kinda tensed up there from all the sitting\" I made up and Danny started kneading and squeezing. With my legs spread already, I could sometimes feel a stretching sensation in my pussy from where he kneaded, it was incredibly arousing, and I wonder if Danny noticed that. \u201cIs this good?\u201d he asked. \u201cMhm, yes, don\u2019t be afraid to dig in\u201d I encouraged him. As he massaged me there I slightly arced my butt up ever so slightly. My brother alternated to massaging other parts of my thighs but frequently came back to that spot on my butt, and I could feel the thong sitting very tightly in my crotch already, with all the motion around it. I knew I was getting wet, but I couldn\u2019t tell how much, and me being oblivious to \"how I looked back there\" but Danny being able to see was a thrilling situation. I felt exposed to my little brother, in a way similar to the accidental flashing. I couldn\u2019t help quietly sighing and moaning occasionally but as I do that anyway when getting massaged I didn\u2019t pay it any mind. \"Uh, can I ask you something Lizzy?\" he asked me. I immediately got a feeling like I was caught and my heart skipped a beat. \"Yes?\" - \"I've never really learned about this, but what you're wearing... is this a thong or a string thong?\" (we call it like this, I think Americans call it G-String). I was very relieved because I thought Danny would have found me out or something, but I was also surprised he didn't know something trivial like this. Typing it out now I think he has less experience with women then I thought. But that little shock actually made me lose my horniness and have a clear mind.\n\nI explained to him how what I wore was a normal thong and the differences to a G-string. As I was doing that, my little brother was massaging my thighs which felt ridiculously unreal. Danny thought as long as the butt is mostly exposed, it's already called a G-string. I could tell it took him quite some courage to ask me that. He eventually finished massaging me and I flipped over and sat up. \"Thanks for the massage little bro\" I thanked him properly and hugged my baby brother firmly. As the YouTube video was actually a guy playing a game, it still went on, about half an hour passed. \"Thanks for explaining me that stuff Sis, I never really learned about that\" Danny admitted embarrassedly. I told him he could ask me \u201cgirl stuff\u201d anytime which he seemed happy about, but when I offered back a massage he just declined and said he \u201cwouldn\u2019t need one\u201d.\n\nAs we stopped hugging, instead of letting me go normally Danny just kind of dropped down along me and put his head on my lap while still having one arm wrapped around me behind my back. I didn't move as I was confused as to what he was doing. He snuggled up into my lap in a way he could still look at the screen, as I was sitting towards the screen myself. I was a little surprised of this move because he never did this, but I didn't mind. \"Are you comfortable like this?\" he asked me in an embarrassed voice, his consideration warmed my heart a little. I assured him I was comfortable after adjusting myself a little and leaning against the wall, and I put my hand on his head and played with his hair slightly. I was a little self-conscious about whether I smelled down there (lol), but Danny didn't complain or show any sign of discomfort. Having his face so close to my crotch felt exciting, but it felt a little strange to have him in my lap and it took me a little time to easen up. Shortly after, the video ended and I decided to go take a shower (where I noticed my thong panties were pretty damp). After showering, I lounged in my room in just my towel in hopes Danny would come in, but he didn\u2019t, so I went over to his room to say good night and then go to bed (sure enough he was gaming haha).\n\nOn Sunday I was going out with some friends and did nothing with Danny. Generally there\u2019s a lot of little teasing I still try to do but mostly just dressing revealingly but casually around the house. I\u2019ll save the notable events of past week for the next post! Lately, I noticed my little brother has become a little more touchy-feely with me, i.e. hugging or offering massages. Interacting with him like this feels way better than just \u201caccidentally\u201d flashing him as I feel like we become closer as siblings and it\u2019s also kinda physical but still innocent (at least to him haha). Maybe I should try to do more with the massages. Thanks guys for all the advice so far and also for worrying about me being gone for a while, I'll try to post again soon.",

I couldn\u2019t help quietly sighing and moaning occasionally but as I do that anyway when getting massaged I didn\u2019t pay it any mind. &amp;quot;Uh, can I ask you something Lizzy?&amp;quot; he asked me. I immediately got a feeling like I was caught and my heart skipped a beat. &amp;quot;Yes?&amp;quot; - &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ve never really learned about this, but what you&amp;#39;re wearing... is this a thong or a string thong?&amp;quot; (we call it like this, I think Americans call it G-String). I was very relieved because I thought Danny would have found me out or something, but I was also surprised he didn&amp;#39;t know something trivial like this. Typing it out now I think he has less experience with women then I thought. But that little shock actually made me lose my horniness and have a clear mind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I explained to him how what I wore was a normal thong and the differences to a G-string. As I was doing that, my little brother was massaging my thighs which felt ridiculously unreal. Danny thought as long as the butt is mostly exposed, it&amp;#39;s already called a G-string. I could tell it took him quite some courage to ask me that. He eventually finished massaging me and I flipped over and sat up. &amp;quot;Thanks for the massage little bro&amp;quot; I thanked him properly and hugged my baby brother firmly. As the YouTube video was actually a guy playing a game, it still went on, about half an hour passed. &amp;quot;Thanks for explaining me that stuff Sis, I never really learned about that&amp;quot; Danny admitted embarrassedly. I told him he could ask me \u201cgirl stuff\u201d anytime which he seemed happy about, but when I offered back a massage he just declined and said he \u201cwouldn\u2019t need one\u201d.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As we stopped hugging, instead of letting me go normally Danny just kind of dropped down along me and put his head on my lap while still having one arm wrapped around me behind my back. I didn&amp;#39;t move as I was confused as to what he was doing. He snuggled up into my lap in a way he could still look at the screen, as I was sitting towards the screen myself. I was a little surprised of this move because he never did this, but I didn&amp;#39;t mind. &amp;quot;Are you comfortable like this?&amp;quot; he asked me in an embarrassed voice, his consideration warmed my heart a little. I assured him I was comfortable after adjusting myself a little and leaning against the wall, and I put my hand on his head and played with his hair slightly. I was a little self-conscious about whether I smelled down there (lol), but Danny didn&amp;#39;t complain or show any sign of discomfort. Having his face so close to my crotch felt exciting, but it felt a little strange to have him in my lap and it took me a little time to easen up. Shortly after, the video ended and I decided to go take a shower (where I noticed my thong panties were pretty damp). After showering, I lounged in my room in just my towel in hopes Danny would come in, but he didn\u2019t, so I went over to his room to say good night and then go to bed (sure enough he was gaming haha).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On Sunday I was going out with some friends and did nothing with Danny. Generally there\u2019s a lot of little teasing I still try to do but mostly just dressing revealingly but casually around the house. I\u2019ll save the notable events of past week for the next post! Lately, I noticed my little brother has become a little more touchy-feely with me, i.e. hugging or offering massages. Interacting with him like this feels way better than just \u201caccidentally\u201d flashing him as I feel like we become closer as siblings and it\u2019s also kinda physical but still innocent (at least to him haha). Maybe I should try to do more with the massages. Thanks guys for all the advice so far and also for worrying about me being gone for a while, I&amp;#39;ll try to post again soon.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

                        "body": "# My personality resembles your brother's a lot (nerdy but not shy, dated girls but still virgin et cetera) and I want to advice you about some stuff.\n\n  \nIf you really want to go forward on this, you should think about what would be your reaction if he really tries something. I can see that you are neither shy nor guilty about trying to seduce him, and that's good since you must be certain when something so delicate like incest is the matter. **It is not wrong or something, but with \"your reaction\" I don't really mean how would you sexually react, if you would be guilty or something after you two having sex. I mean how would you react if he starts liking you** ***romantically***.\n\nI've read your posts, you write really well! But it looks like you are just looking for some sex, maybe an adventure. **I may be wrong, just say otherwise if so**. The whole problem is that your brother *never* had sex before, he *never* had a proper relationship. As far as I remember you said that he dated some girl(s?) before but nothing too deep. Just think about it, you would be his first sexual partner, as his sister. I know that it is not a big deal anymore (the first sexual experience I mean), but he is \"\\~\\~le gamer\" just like I used to be, so I know exactly how this group think. **This kind of people, those who spend hours and hours playing computer games tend to be very sensitive. Like a lot, really!**\n\nAt least in the games I used to play (LoL, Overwatch, MMORPGs, FPS) 90% of the people who I played with, maybe even more, were males. Also, the very act of socializing through the computer is totally distinct of the act of going out with your friends, it is just not the same. Just think about as your social skills as something that must be trained like any other skill, and you basically only socialize with males, and the way you socialize isn't really real. I know you said that he has a social life, friends and so, but spending a lot of time playing isn't healthy, not even a bit. Neither to your physical nor to your mental health. As I said before I'm not shy, I could even say that I'm a talkative person, but my social skills (even more those related to women) were greatly affected, and I still a virgin nowadays. I'm getting over it fortunately, even if slowly.\n\n**You should really beware with this whole thing. You make him horny, it is noticeable that he sees you like a woman, you are his sister but he would bang you. But then what? You would really proceed in a (at least) casual relationship? You must think about it before going any further.That is the point I'm trying to make when talking about a 'gamer' behavior, that your brother is probably at least a little distinct to the other guys of his age when it is related to women, more sensitive. And it is obviously intensified because you are his sister. So if you are not enough careful you could do some damage to him.**\n\n# \n\n# Now some other important stuff.\n\nI see that you are trying to make him horny, to be lewd, but **if you want to continue you should try to talk more with him about women and most importantly about** ***you,*** **from now on**. You said that you asked him about some girl of his class and about former girlfriends, but **you should now also ask more incisive questions**. **Not something so obvious like \"*****What do you think about incest?*****\", \"*****Do you think I'm hot?*****\", \"Would you bang me right now?\", of course not. I mean something more superficial, but incisive nevertheless.** Like \"*What kind of women are you interested in*?\" \\[then you could talk about some friend of yours (even if there is none) that is looking for someone so it wouldn't look so strange\\], \"*Some guy said I look - insert any flaw you have (or don't) here-, do you think so?*\", some questions that would falsely show some low-self-esteem in you (to see if he would praise/defend you at all). Maybe say some stuff about the appearance of a man or someone who both of you know, showing some Facebook photo, only to see if he would look jealous. **It is crucial for you to pay attention about his reactions to any question of yours, at this point he really wouldn't manage to hide it very well if he is really interested in you.**\n\nYou said that he doesn't look so interested, but **maybe he just doesn't know how to draw near to you**. Those initial *small*, *superficial* but *incisive* questions would make him see that you are a 'possibility', just do it slowly then try some more significant questions in the long run.\n\n  \n&gt;!Personal hint: even if you two don't turn into lovers or something, try to be closer to him, as a sister. It would be good to both of you, even more for him, to have a female friend.!&lt;\n\nGood luck, don't give up on him!",

I commented on someone's comment a little down about what you can do for the next massage, but I'll just say it here as well. Next time, wear a bra, one that can open from the back, and of course something over, preferably a tank top or crop top. Then either wait for him to ask you if you want a massage, or you can ask him to give you one. Once he starts, you can say something along the lines of: \"Argh, I feel the top catching on my bra. I wasn't wearing one the last time you massaged me. Is it alright with you if I take it off?\". Of course, he'll bable out a yes. Now you're only in bra and panties, more intimate than before. From here, it's also possible to open the bra...\n2. He definently has something for legs/feet. He wanted to massage those last time, and the same this time. Perhaps you could use this in some way. Stockings, long socks, whatever.\n3. You should take a picture or look in the mirror to see how wet you are, and how visible it is - which i think it is.\n4. As he asked that question about the thong, he must've been looking a lot at your ass and panties (naturally and expected of course). And yeah, i'm pretty sure you would be visibly wet.\n5. Him laying his head in your lap could be several different things, probably a mix. For one, it ads to him liking legs (and feet). You should also take in mind that he's maybe trying to smell you. That's what I would be doing like that, honestly. I would recommend you to at some point lay your head on him the same way. This shows equal liking and intimacy. I'm sure that would have some kind of reaction as well. Maybe it's possible for you to move your head back as well, hitting him \"there\"...\n6. About it being innocent to him. I highly doubt that. I'm sure he feels the same things you do. The excitment. At least it's not 100% innocent, and he knows.\n7. Last thing. Even though he says he doesn't want a massage, you should give him one as well. His sister's soft hands on his body will do things to him (and in another way, you as well) that I'm sure he'll like. You can also tease him this way by pressing up against him in different ways.\n\nSorry it got so long, but I hope some of this helps, and that it isn't too late :)",
