                        "selftext": "TLDR: My SIL caught my GF and I having sex once, tried to sneakily open the door on us a second time, has been more physically affectionate towards me and when sharing a hotel room with her sister and me complained about why she had to be careful not to walk around \"exposed\" while my GF didn't. She also might have been awake and watching while my GF and I had \"sneaky\" sex when sharing the hotel room and thought she was asleep, I still have no clue if she was awake or not. I have doubts whether this means anything or I'm letting myself assume things and I'd like some outsider perspective.\n\nNothing has happened yet, and I doubt it will, but I've had the suspicion my SIL is interested in *something* with either me or both my GF and I. So I guess I'm just looking to tell someone and maybe get some idea as to what is going on.\n\nFor context, I've been together with my GF for almost 8 years now, and we've known each other for 11. Obviously I've known my SIL for just as long, we met just a couple of weeks after I met my GF.\n\nFor most of my relationship I never got any sort of vibe from my SIL. We've had a great relationship for the entire time, I have 4 brothers but not a single sister and I don't get along with my cousins much, so she became very much like a sister to me. We joke around, annoy each other, and talk a lot, what I assume a S/B relationship would be. It really is great and I never had any reason to suspect other interests until around two or three years ago.  \n\nIt began when my GF mentioned how her sister had talked to their mother about our relationship and how it made her jealous how my GF managed to go strong for so long and how she still hasn't managed to have something similar. During the 8 years we've been together, she's gone out with several people but never had any relationship for longer than a few months. Again, this didn't seem strange to me, even my brothers were impressed *I* managed to have a 5 year relationship. What really got me thinking happened later that same year. \n\nWhat makes me wonder the most is this. As said, she and I are very close, we talk a lot and most importantly try annoy each other. The three of us were watching TV in the living room when my GF and I began sexting while sitting next to each other, obviously we ended up suggesting taking things to her bedroom. My GF was a little embarrassed to get up, so I decided to just tell her sister we'd be heading into the room. My GF and I never tiptoed around the subject of sex when we talked to her sister and the subject came up, she had already caught us in the act once before just as I was putting my condom on, so she got a very good view of *everything*. She didn't interrupt us at all, we didn't realize she was home untill after we were finished and weren't aware she had seen us untill she brought it up with my GF. After such an explicit encounter it wasn't too awkward for any of us when I just said \"We're going to head to the room for a while\" she laughed a bit and responded with \"ok, have fun\". It was made very clear we were about to get it on, and it was just a few minutes later when things got wierd.\n\nThings had just started to get passionate when we heard the distinctive sound of a door handle being turned. It wasn't just her trying to get into the room because she forgot what was going on, the door handle was being turned so slowly and sneakily my GF and I had time to hear the thing and look around to see it slowly turning untill the lock stopped it. Of course, we had locked the door due to modesty, just because she knows what's happening doesn't mean we're just leaving an open invitation. But that's the thing that got me thinking, it was obvious what we were doing, so why did she try to open the door and try to do it so quietly? \n\nAfter that, there was no similar incident, but I began notice how she became more physically affectionate. She hugs me more often, rests her head on my shoulder when watching TV together, holds my arm while walking, that sort of thing. I had really stopped thinking about it for quite a long time, untill this last weekend. \n\nMy GF's youngest niece just turned 4 so I traveled out of state with her family for the party and stayed at the same hotel. My GF, her sister and I shared a room since it was only going to be a single night, but all it took to make me doubt again was a the morning routine. As you could imagine my SIL and I had to be careful not to move around the room while we were getting ready as to not see each other anywhere near naked, my GF however had no such worries, obviously. My SIL's response to our caution is what makes me doubt, while I was in the bathroom brushing my teeth I heard her very seriously ask her sister why she couldn't just walk around without worries too. I didn't mention anything to either of them, but obviously I would find it a bit awkward for all three of us to nonchalantly walk around naked, not to mention my GF would obviously be more than jealous and annoyed at her sister. It doesn't help that the night before, my GF and I had sex a while after we believed she fell asleep. My SIL hasn't brought it up explicitly, but she did say she had trouble falling asleep the night before and was tossing and turning for a while. She didn't move at all during the time leading up to or while we were having sex, but she was facing towards us while it was happening and turned the other way only seconds after we finished and I got up to get my GF some toilet paper.\n\nI would've just assumed it was her trying to tease or annoy her sister, which must be at least in part true, but it is the fact that she has caught us in the act once before and tried to do so a second time which leads me to believe there's some curiosity there. I think I'm just exaggerating things and letting my imagination run wild, but I really can't get these situations out of my head.\n\nI hope you at least enjoyed my speculative story, but if you think you've got some perspective on a similar experience which could clear doubts don't hesitate to comment, even if you just confirm I'm letting my imagination run wild.\n\nEDIT: Added TLDR at the top just in case.",

I don't think saying \"hey I think your sister is flirting with me\" would go over well, I feel like it would come off as me trying to convince her of something. She's been a little bothered by how well I get along with her sister since before these \"incidents\", she feels we're a little too close and can't help but feel scared something might happen, but she trusts me and I fully believed we just had a very brotherly friendship.\n\nI only began to doubt my SIL's intentions when she tried to open the door on us, but that went away untill this instance with her suggesting she should be able to walk around me while getting ready. I don't feel we're anywhere near close enough to the level of trust needed to not be bothered at being naked around each other, so I don't know why she would.\n\nI'm really just looking for an idea if I'm making things up in my mind or if there's actually a reason to believe it's true.

She&amp;#39;s been a little bothered by how well I get along with her sister since before these &amp;quot;incidents&amp;quot;, she feels we&amp;#39;re a little too close and can&amp;#39;t help but feel scared something might happen, but she trusts me and I fully believed we just had a very brotherly friendship.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I only began to doubt my SIL&amp;#39;s intentions when she tried to open the door on us, but that went away untill this instance with her suggesting she should be able to walk around me while getting ready. I don&amp;#39;t feel we&amp;#39;re anywhere near close enough to the level of trust needed to not be bothered at being naked around each other, so I don&amp;#39;t know why she would.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m really just looking for an idea if I&amp;#39;m making things up in my mind or if there&amp;#39;s actually a reason to believe it&amp;#39;s true. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
