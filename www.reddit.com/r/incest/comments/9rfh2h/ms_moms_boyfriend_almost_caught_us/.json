To have sex with her in that moment is to take advantage of someone who is vulnerable and not thinking clearly.  \n\nLook at his account of how it happened.

In other words, not only did he not show respect and recognize she was not in the mental or emotional state to behave how she had told him she wanted to behave, but he manipulated it to his advantage.  He was about to give up, but as soon as she was where he wanted her, he took control of a helpless woman to fulfill his desires.  That disturbs me as someone with mental health issues, who knows how mania interferes with the mind.  And after she was victimized by her dad, who sexually assaulted her, now her own son is doing the same, using her for his gain.  It's repulsive, and exactly what I expected from the way he tried to manipulate her before.\n\nAlso, it's not like mania just exposes the secret desires that was inhibited while a person is stable.  It transforms that person's thinking.  And hypersexuality will lead to actions that may not happen when sober-minded . . . with anyone, even those that the individual would not pursue with a clear head.  Remember, when she gave him a hand job, she felt really guilty about it and blamed her bipolar.  That is what happens when brain chemistry manipulates someone's action.

As someone with Bipolar disorder who remembers and regrets mistakes I made while I was manic, I hope you are ready to care for her and support her when she comes down from her high and realizes what she did, and what you allowed to happen by not keeping her concerns from when she is stable in mind.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Be ready for all of that emotional baggage to come out again, from her dad and now from you, the latest person to take advantage of her.  She will feel guilty about it, but it was out of her control.  You let it happen because of your selfish desires.  Just know a Bipolar individual does remember what he or she did while manic, and does enter depression, and so she will know about this when she is of sound mind again.  You didn&amp;#39;t even hesitate.  You just took it from her when she was under the influence of something out of her control.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So if she is not stable yet, and still manic, be ready.  There will be repercussions.  And you deserve all the blame that comes with it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
