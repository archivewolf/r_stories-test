I wasn\u2019t fully happy with how things turned out, but the short story is that we ended up having sex, but I was wildly disappointed.\n \n\nFrom the beginning, my intention wasn\u2019t to have sex with him, but I really enjoyed the teasing and the way I felt kind of ashamed of exposing myself to him. But after our last session, I think he was expecting it, and it felt like the natural thing to do, despite my feeling unsure about it.\n\n \nThis is just over a month ago now. We got to be alone for a few hrs, and he it didn\u2019t take long for him to ask if we could have some fun like we did last time. I was pretty happy about him finally taking initiative for once. I\u2019ve been wanting him to do that since the beginning. But as I mentioned, given how far things progressed last time, as soon as we started, he was already feeling my boobs this time. There was no light touching, not really any massage. Those were the things that really drove me crazy horny, got me super wet and excited. It basically ended up with both of us naked, and him touching me for a while.\n\n \nIt\u2019s not that I wasn\u2019t horny. I really was, but it was nowhere near any of my previous sessions. I wasn\u2019t scared, the thrill of it all didn\u2019t feel the same, and he was much more bold. He focused on my boobs for a while, before he reached for my pussy. I simply went along. Again, I was horny, it\u2019s just the feeling was different. I spread my legs for him, and I was already rather wet. He fingered me for another few minutes, mixing between 1 and 2 fingers. I was moaning rather hard, and I admit I could have easily orgasmed if he had continued for longer.\n\n \nHe continued for a few minutes, before he pulled his fingers out. Started kind of stuttering, and directly asked me if we could try having sex. And that\u2019s the feeling that I crave. The sudden rush of emotions, feeling vulnerable, kind of ashamed, the excitement. I had said it before, I am not physically attracted to him, and his dick is average size. But it\u2019s the whole taboo of it that drives me crazy. I agreed to it, as I was pretty mentally prepared that we were going to do it. His face light up, I don\u2019t think I ever seen him smile that much.\n \n\nI laid on his bed, very nervous, scared, but really excited, and still very wet. I told him not to worry about a condom, as I was on the pill. He simply said \u201cOh Ok\u201d I honestly don\u2019t think it even crossed his mind given how horny he was. I could tell he was nervous, but he was already very hard. Didn\u2019t need any help with HJ, or a BJ. We started in missionary. He got on top of me, still smiling. The second he pushed in me, he started moaning. He starts pumping slowly, and I am trying to fully relax, but I can\u2019t seem to enjoy it. It\u2019s a weird feeling, being super horny, but nervous (not even sure why), but I couldn\u2019t fully relax. We fucked barely for a minutes, and thankfully he didn\u2019t cum right away. I ask him to switch position.\n \n\nI get into doggy position, still on his bed and he was standing. This already felt a bit better. The position, and maybe not to have to look him directly in the eyes. He starts fucking me again, much harder this time, and still moaning a lot. This feels a lot better, and I am trying to rub my nipples a bit, but it he barely lasted a minute in this position, before I could hear him grunt, and I started feeling him cum inside me. He pulls out, super face, \u201coh wow, this was amazing\u201d he is proud of himself, I am quiet disappointed, but I understand, given it\u2019s his first time and all. He kept saying how awesome this way, how much he loved it. And meanwhile, I am feeling awkward, uncomfortable. My stupid mind couldn\u2019t decide how to feel about this whole thing.\n\n \nI get up, and tell him that it was good, but I need a quick shower. For the first time since I\u2019ve been fooling around with him, I wasn\u2019t able to orgasm in the shower on my own. Really big mixed feeling this time. As I got out, we\u2019re talking to each other, but it feels a bit awkward. We didn\u2019t say much about it afterwards. We never really did before either.\n\n \nOverall I am Ok with the whole thing, but I am really disappointed that I lost the aspect that I enjoyed the most. I am sure that sex will get better, but I am not sure I will want to do it again with him. The thrill kind of died, and it almost felt like just sex with a random guy. I\u2019ll see how things go, but I\u2019ll have to slow things down with him or just end it completely. I am pretty sure he will want to try it again now.\n\n",
