I only met my mom when I was 16 and I just started living with her and her boyfriend (50M) about four months ago.\n\nMy mom is pretty average looking, I'm not going to lie and say she's a porn star. Black hair, brown eyes, 5'8\", sort of pudgy around her midsection, flat ass, but big naturally shaped boobs. She's got a ton of tattoos. Wears glasses and usually keeps her hair up in a bun. She was sort of a mess, recovering addict, been in prison, but she has a good job at a local printing company and is sort of normal which is why when things went bad with my dad and stepmom she invited me to live with her.\n\nI really didn't have a thing for her ever but she walks around in just a t-shirt and panties, so I can see her nipples all the time and when she bends over for something you can see her pussy lips from behind and that's kinda sexy.\n\nLast night I was in my room (in the basement) laying in bed watching TV when she came in wearing a black silk bathrobe and carrying a laundry basket. She had it sort of loosely tied around her waist and the top was just kind of hanging open. She asked if I had put all my dirty clothes in the laundry room because she was going to put a load in. I said yes and she saw my gym shorts on the floor and bend over to pick it up and I saw her big tits just hanging there, in full view from her loosely tied bathrobe.\n\nShe stood up and saw me and asked if I was staring at her tits. I was too nervous to say anything and she put the laundry basket down and sat on the bed and said it was okay so I said yeah I was. She smiled at me and said I had grown up and become such a handsome man and kinda rubbed my chest. She said was was impressed I had the body of a man now.\n\nShe slipped her bathrobe open and shit, her tits had just this giant natural shape to them and she has huge nipples and big areolas. She asked if I liked mommy's tits and BAM I was kind instantly hard. I could just manage a nod and she stroked my abs (I'm no John Cena just got skinny abs), outlined them with her finger, then reached down into my underwear and started stroking my dick. She told me I really had a man's body and stroked my cock just under my head. She asked if I liked the way mommy touched my cock and when she said mommy I grunted and came right there in my boxers while she jerked me off. The whole thing lasted maybe 15 seconds. She kind of moaned when I came and said \"Oooh yeah give me that hot cum.\" She seemed really into it.\n\nThen her attitude like totally shifted and she said this was just \"fooling around\" and \"a little secret for us\" and I \"didn't need to tell her boyfriend\" or he'd kick us both out.\n\nI honestly was still in shock so I just agreed with her. She told me to shower and change and give her my cum filled boxers for the laundry which I did. Part of me hoped she would come into the shower with me but she never did. When I got out she was in her boyfriend's bedroom with the door closed so I just went to bed but could barely sleep.\n\nThis morning she was gone to work before I had to leave for class. But at noon she sends me these long rambling text messages. She says she's sorry for last night, she didn't mean to do that with me and hopes I can forgive her. She said she's bipolar and currently off her medication and she was having a mania episode and couldn't control herself. She described herself as a sex addict which she said was the \"root of all her problems\" and then said when she was younger she had a sexual relationship with her father which \"warped her sexuality.\" She said she's so sorry and she just wants me to have a normal life and she hopes I can forgive her. She pleaded for me not to tell her boyfriend because he wouldn't understand.\n\nUm, I don't know what to think about this and does this mean I have no chance of making it happen again?",
