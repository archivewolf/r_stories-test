I just wasn't interested. Finally I just shut it off and told Mom she was far more interesting than a darned movie.\n\n\nWe sat on the couch for a while and I held her hand in mine.\nI asked her what she thought of everything so far and she said there was just too much to process so she didn't know what to think.\nThis was the first time alone we had had since Jenny arrived so I asked her about their time todgether on the way home from the airport and the time they spent the day after.\nMom said Jenny hadn't waited very long before asking what was going on between Mom and I.\nShe just bored right in.\n\n\nMom said she had fobbed Jen off at first but then decided to let it all out and tell the truth about it.\nShe said the conversation was a little like\u00a0 an attorney questioning a witness in court.\n\n\nJenny, \"So, You and  Tom are involved somehow?\"\n\n\nMom, \"Yes.\"\n\n\n\"An emotional relationship?\"\n\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\nJen asked, \"Is it a sexual relationship?\"\n\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\n\"Oh good God! Really? You are sleeping together?\"\n\n\nMom said, \"Yes.\"\n\n\n\"You two are having sex together??\"\n\n\nMom said she didnt know how a couple could have a sexual relationship without having sex.\nJenny freaked out and lambasted Mom for making light about such a serious issue. \nAnd then, as the old saying goes, the fight started.\nMom said she had expected some criticism but nothing as harsh as Jenny gave her.\n\n\nJenny, \"How long has this been going on?\" \n\n\nMom, \"Since February 4th.\"\n\n\n\"You know the exact date?\"\n\n\n\"I wrote it in my heart.\"\n\n\nJenny, \"Did you just do it like a couple of cattle?\"\n\n\nMom said she got mad and said, \"I will answer your questions but you will Not insult me! We are not cattle. It was a long, confusing, romantic thing that blossomed into love, then mutual desire and then sex.\"\n\n\nJen, \"When did it start?\"\n\n\n\"Over a year ago. In August.\"\n\n\nJen, \"What happened?\u00a0 How did it start?\"\n\n\nMom told her she had had a couple of strange dreams about me. Making love with me and all that.\nShe told Jenny I had broke up with the girl I was seeing and we talked about it. \n\"One of the things he told me was she kept herself shaved and he liked it.\"\n\n\n\"Down...?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\n\"Then what?\"\n\n\nThen one Saturday I shaved myself.\"\n\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\n\"To this day I don't know why but maybe subconsciously it was to be attractive to him.\"\n\"Then what?\"\n\"Well, I left enough evidence in the bathroom and he noticed it and asked me about it. I really didn't do it on purpose.\"\nJen asked, \"Do what on purpose? Shave?\"\n\"No. I mean I shaved on purpose I guess but I didn't leave hair in the bathroom on purpose.\"\n\n\n\"So he came right out and asked you?\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\"Then what?\"\n\n\n\"He wondered why and he pestered and teased me about it.\"\n\n\n\"Why didn't you just tell him to MYOB?\"\n\n\n\"I did. I got mad at him for it.\"\n\n\n\"Then what?\"\n\n\"Well, over the next couple of months his behavior towards me changed.\nHe was more attentive and kind. He acted more like a man around me and less like a kid. He seemed genuinely interested in me and didn't take me for granted like a son does his mom.\nThen it became more obvious that he started wooing me. I could see it in his eyes.\"\n\n\nThen Mom said she started crying and my sister felt sorry for her and asked her not to cry. She told Jenny it had been since before she and dad were married that a man had pursued her so gently and lovingly. She told Jen she realized how much she had missed that and went out on a few dates with different guys but the dates were complete duds. And I was there in front of her, steady and kind and patient. Most of all she trusted me.\nShe told Jen it just slowly developed and finally she realized she didn't just want me in her dreams but she wanted me in real life.\n\"Then one thing lead to another untill February when it finally happened.\"\nShe told Jen, \"I didn't make it easy mind you. He did work hard for me.\"\n\n\nJen said, \"Good God Mother! Your own son.\"\n\n\nMom said she started crying again and Jen stopped asking questions till they got home from the airport then she started asking questions again.\nShe asked, \"So you've been doing this since February?\"\n\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\n\"Why didn't you tell me?\"\n\"Because you don't tell people these things. Not even your own daughter. Look at the grief it's causing now.\"\n\n\nThen Jen asked, \"Don't you have any shame or regrets about it?\"\n\n\nMom said she told Jen, \"I have some shame here and now with you but I have no regrets about it otherwise. I know Tom doesn't either.\"\n\n\nJen asked her what if Tom leaves you someday for another.\n\n\n\"I told her the son naturally leaves his mother at some point but would enjoy what we have untill then.\"\n\n\n\"That's about the time you came home and it ended the conversation.\"\n\n\nSo I asked her why she cried so hard but Mom couldnt say exactly.\n\"Maybe it was a\u00a0 feeling like I was a terrible failure as a mother to have let this happen.\"\n\n\nI asked,\" Is that how you feel about us?\"\n\n\nMom said, \"No I don't feel that way at all\nwhen I'm with you but I guess I did in the presence of my daughter.\"\n\n\nI knew I would wonder about that last statement for a while.\nThen I asked what they had done the next day while I was at work and they were together all day.\nMom said they talked a lot. The conversation sort of went on all day.\nI asked if they had fought.\nMom said they hadn't fought but Jen was really angry a few times and did say some mean things to her. But then she felt sorry and apologized and cried.\nI asked what mom did then and she said she cried too to see Jenny so distressed but\u00a0 she was aware she was the mother and tried to take care of Jen even though it was all very difficult.\nI asked if Jen thinks I am an jerk or worse for my part in this.\nMom said Jen acted like it is more your fault than mine but she hadnt called  you bad names like she did to me.\nMom said the term slut was one of the milder ones Jen used.\nI told mom that they had seemed more settled or relaxed when I got home and she said they were both emotionally exhausted when I got home and they welcomed the diversion of me being there and going out to dinner.\nMom and I talked about this stuff till it was late then agreed it was time for bed.\nFunny but we both went to our own rooms and didnt even discuss that before we went to our rooms.\n\nSaturday morning Jenny got home about 10 and we all mostly hung around till noon when we had to bring her to the airport. We didn't talk about Mom and I.\nMom had bought some gifts for Jen's kids and gave them to her.\nThe cat was now totally out of the bag and we all needed time to process everything and not much was said about it.\nWhen we left her at the airport Jenny gave Mom a long hug and they both had tears in their eyes. Then she hugged me too and went through the gate.\nWe both felt tired on the way home and did not talk much but I did mention how I had wondered how we would ever be able to tell Jen what had happened between us and at least now that part of it was behind us.\nMom agreed but she felt bad that Jenny had taken it so hard though she had known she would if she ever found out.\n\n\nI mowed the lawn and did yardwork in the afternoon. It felt good to be physical and concentrate on the tasks at hand. It's hard to sustain the cerebral and emotional stuff too long.\nYesterday evening I called out for a pizza and then we played Scrabble till bedtime. Neither of us were very good at it but we kept playing just to be together and not have to talk about Jen. One thing we agreed on was despite this huge disruption in our lives we were both sad to see Jenny was gone.\nWho knows maybe permanently...\nThen again nothing was said about sleeping together and we went to our own seperate rooms.\n",
