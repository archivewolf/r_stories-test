                        "selftext": "Hey, everyone. It\u2019s me again. I figured I\u2019d update everyone on the relationship with my mom and the new medication I\u2019m trying, trimix. It\u2019s pretty solid I must say. It\u2019s a medication that is taken through injection. Essentially what you do is take the syringe and stick the base of your penis with it and inject the fluid. I assumed the first time I\u2019d take it, it would be rather painful. It honestly wasn\u2019t. It was a slight stick and that\u2019s it but on to what happened. \n\nIt was a Sunday morning. My mom and I were both home from work. My mom was up before I was doing some cleaning like she always does on Sundays. I rolled out of my bed in my boxers and went to go get cleaned up in the bathroom. I then went into the kitchen, still in my boxers, to meet my mother. I usually stay in my boxers for a decent part of the day on Sundays. The reason being is that it is our rest day, and we usually aren\u2019t doing anything but just staying home, so I waltz into the kitchen, we say our good mornings to each other, and I kiss her. We talk for a little while and have breakfast together. I returned to my room, and she returned to her cleaning.  \n\nI was really curious to see how well this trimix worked. I just couldn\u2019t contain myself and decided to take my first dose. I waited a little while for it to kick in and rubbed my member as I did, gradually bringing my self to a pretty strong erection. I then left my room to seek my mother\u2019s relief. \n\nI looked around for her eventually finding her in the bathroom bent over cleaning the bathtub. Her ass looked absolutely delicious in the leggings she was wearing. On days like these she usually just wears something comfortable to do her cleaning. Today, it was a nice tight pair of leggings that hugged her full, ample ass and a loose white, cotton t-shirt. She hadn\u2019t realized I was in the bathroom, so I kind of sneaked up on her. I first popped out my cock out of the whole in my boxers and slowly made my way behind her lovely bottom where I placed my hands on each one of her hips. She jumped and was initially startled until she turned her head to see me. She started giggling stating I had scared her. The whole while, I was grinding my very engorged cock on her soft ass. She purred and stated I felt really hard. I looked at my cock smothered in-between my mother\u2019s thick ass cheeks and realized it was true. My cock was raging hard. Veins engorged with blood, protruded from the base of my shaft.\n\nShe laughed again making a comment, \u201ca bad case of morning wood, huh\u201d. She told me to open our bathroom cupboard and pull out a bottle of lotion. She got up from her position at the bathtub and repositioned herself over the edge of our bathroom sink, so she would have more room. She then instructed me to pull down her leggings which I promptly did exposing her large, full bottom. From this point on, I needed no further instruction. I knew exactly what to do. I grabbed the bottle of lotion and squirted a decent amount in-between her cheeks. I then spurted some into my hand and started lubricating my cock. Now ready, I placed my throbbing penis in-between her cheeks and began hotdogging my own mother. I shlicked my raging boner through my mother\u2019s buttery cheeks for more than 10 minutes. My cock was like a hot knife melting its way through its a stick of butter, and butter was of the essence, as a familiar surge in my balls made itself apparent. I began spewing my own butter, glazing my mother\u2019s ass cheeks and even getting some into her rosebud when I quickly dipped the head of my dick into it. I finished, panting, but my cock still very rigid. A little while later, she started pushing the cum out of her ass. I grabbed some toilet paper and began to tab her pucker as she did. It felt extremely intimate sharing something so personal with my mother. I told her to finish her cleaning and meet me in the living room when she did. \n\nI went to sit on our couch waiting for her when she eventually appeared. My cock was standing fully erect. She looked at it and was wowed. She asked if I needed more help, and I nodded my head. She got on her knees in between my legs and started stroking my head, occasionally kissing the tip. Eventually, she took the rest of my shaft into her mouth and started massaging it with her tongue. This went on with her sucking and popping and eventually getting to my balls. She talks to me in a way that I call \u201cdirty mommy talk\u201d when blowing me. Upon taking my balls into her mouth, she said something along the lines of, \u201cdo you like when mommy sucks on your achy balls\u201d and \u201clet mommy drain you baby, deep into my throat\u201d. When I did just that , she took me back into her throat, and I began shooting my ropes into her mouth as she gradually swallowed. She popped off my cock, surprised that it was still hard. \n\nI then told her she needs to ride it out. She complied and impaled herself on my cock and rode me for the next half hour ending with me spewing my goo into her again.She kissed me one last time, and the we both got dressed. My hard on finally subsided, and I was glad it managed to get me through such a heated session with my mom. \n\nSo there it is, another miracle drug. With all the medication I\u2019m taking, I do believe it\u2019s fair I do eventually tell her. I plan to so at the end of the week. I say this as I still want to deeply enjoy sex with her while still taking this medication without any repercussion. I thank you all again for your help upon resolving my problem and being here for me on my journey",
