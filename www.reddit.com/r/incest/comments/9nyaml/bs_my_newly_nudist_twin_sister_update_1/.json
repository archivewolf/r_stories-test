It is nice to know internet strangers are kind and thoughtful, however perverted they may be!**\n\n**On that point, while my name does happen to be David, my sister\u2019s is not Amy. While we did grow up near a major airport hub, it was not Chicago, and while I am going to school on the west coast, it is not U of A. (It was my favorite, but I did not get accepted, thank you very much.) I think I fictionalized enough of the actual details that some crazy person is not going to dox me.**\n\n**For the internet supersleuth asking how she lives off campus, you can pretty much always get an exemption at every school I have heard of. In her case, housing is impacted, so they give you an option. Please don\u2019t ask me whether it was lottery or random selection or what form was submitted. If you cannot suspend your disbelief of what you read on the internet long enough to concede this reasonable truth, then don\u2019t read things on the internet, I guess.**\n\n**Yes, I have an interest in writing. I am probably going to go with English when I have to declare my major. More than your pervy comments, (which are totally fine, btw; I posted to a pervy sub) I really appreciate your input on my writing specifically. Honestly, I cannot tell if I am a good writer, and receiving feedback (however weird it may be to come from this forum) is greatly appreciated. On this point I must admit: I am writing this dialog from my paraphrased memory of the actual events to make it into a story for your enjoyment. Some dialog is verbatim as I remember it. Some just conveys what happened.**\n\n**Someone sent me a DM that this story sounded \u201chonest.\u201d I frankly don\u2019t think I am THAT good of a writer that I could just make this shit up. If it seems honest, it is likely because it really happened. If you don\u2019t want to believe it, that is totally cool. Getting this out in an anonymous forum is my only therapy on the matter, so I\u2019m really doing this more for me than for you.**\n\n**Lastly, no, I am not going to send a picture of my sister\u2019s naked body. I don\u2019t even want something like that on my phone, much less the internet.**\n\n**With all that out of the way, let me continue...**\n\nAmy got up to pee. With the door open. I sat on the bed and watched her while she sat on the toilet. She smiled and waved at me. I smiled and shook my head. She came back and sat on the bed again, facing me.\n\n\u201cI guess we should talk about that,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cYa think?\u201d We both laughed.\n\n\u201cSo...\u201d I started, but didn\u2019t really know where to go with it.\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d she said. \u201cThat was definitely sexual.\u201d She giggled and patted my knee. \u201cBut not, like, between us. Does that make sense?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe just co-masturbated,\u201d I said.\n\nShe laughed.\n\n\u201cYeah but,\u201d she said, \u201cLike, why do you think it wasn\u2019t weird?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe continue to disagree on the meaning of the term weird.\u201d We both laughed.\n\nBut I understood what she meant. Being a twin is a thing a lot of people cannot relate to. You grow up never really feeling like you are an individual. I know other twins \u2013 identicals \u2013 for whom this is a much bigger deal. Their DNA is identical. Think about that. You are never really your own person. You are always defined as one of a pair. Your pictures from your childhood have you in the same outfits. People call you \u201cthe twins.\u201d You can either embrace it or reject it. I have heard of twins that have sour relationships in part because they had to exert their independence from each other to feel like an individual.\n\nFor Amy and me, it was the opposite. We never had to compete for attention or anything like that. Maybe because she is a girl, we never really fought the way two boys might. In fact, it was always really comforting for both of us that we had each other. It is very much like having an extension of yourself. Our relationship has always been more honest because we never felt like there was any chance of betrayal because you wouldn\u2019t betray yourself, you know? Anyway, we have shared a lot of intimate details over the years, from as long as I can remember. Embarrassing things you may never tell a soul, we would readily confide in each other about. There are things we know about each other that we will take to the grave. Advice on everything under the sun was always a short conversation away.\n\nIt is for all these reasons that I understood what she meant by all this not being weird. It is because she feels as comfortable with me regarding literally everything as I do with her. After your sister has driven to bring you a change of clothes after you accidentally shit your pants at work, there is not much that is off limits. (That is a true story, and it just pained me deeply to recall that memory and write that sentence.) After you have been the only person she would trust to carefully examine her butthole because it was itchy and she was afraid it was something horrible, nothing feels like you cannot go there. Simply put, we have been \u201cbros\u201d for so long, had each other\u2019s backs so many times, and been so intimately intertwined for so long, that I totally understood what she was trying to say. Jerking off alone is totally normal. Jerking off with someone who feels like an extension of yourself, while maybe not totally normal, is also not out of the realm of reason.\n\n\u201cI know what you mean,\u201d I said. \u201cI feel like I should feel guilty for violating some major taboo, but I don\u2019t at all.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight! That\u2019s what I\u2019m saying. Even though that was obviously sexual, it just felt like we were doing it together. But not with each other.\u201d She looked at me, and I was smirking and she laughed and hit my leg playfully.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not explaining this very well,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cNo, yes you are,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re my brother, but you\u2019re like my best friend. But it\u2019s more than that.\u201d She was looking at the wall over my shoulder, searching for words.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like you\u2019re me,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cRight, yeah,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel as comfortable around you as I do myself. I literally don\u2019t feel a difference. There are married couples who never pee in front of each other, but we\u2019ve always been totally open with each other about everything.\u201d\n\nShe stood looking at me for a few moments, and then added, \u201cI hope this doesn\u2019t sound wrong, but the reason I know this isn\u2019t weird is because I don\u2019t want to have sex with you.\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t realize it until she said it, but that was exactly why it wasn\u2019t weird. There was no lust, no longing, no unrequited love or anything that would feel deeply confusing. We just got off together. We had walked in on each other several times in the past doing the exact same thing, and it wasn\u2019t some big deal that was totally embarrassing. In fact, I am surprised that we didn\u2019t do something like that way back when puberty was hitting, just to experiment together, because that is something we totally would have done.\n\n\u201cWait that might have come out wrong,\u201d she said, and then started giggling.\n\n\u201cNo, no,\u201d I said. \u201cYou just put your finger on it. Other people probably couldn\u2019t understand because they don\u2019t have our history together, but you\u2019re right. This doesn\u2019t feel one bit illicit.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d She said, \u201cSo we\u2019re good.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re good,\u201d I said. \u201cWe\u2019re weird, but we\u2019re good.\u201d\n\nThen she leaned in and hugged me while we were both laughing.\n\n\u201cSo now what?\u201d She asked, after we had pulled apart.\n\n\u201cI mean, I guess we stay naked and randomly masturbate when the mood strikes?\u201d\n\nShe hit me with a pillow and said, \u201cYep that about sums it up!\u201d Then she was still smiling when she said, \u201cI\u2019ve really got the greatest brother.\u201d\n\nWe fell asleep that night holding hands. The next morning I woke up and she was gone. There was a text on my phone that she had gone for a jog, so I got up and took a shower. I had only been in the shower a couple minutes when she came home. I have a little mirror in my shower, but she doesn\u2019t. So I was trying to shave by hanging out the shower and looking in the bathroom mirror. She had stripped her clothes off at the door as usual and came in the bathroom and sat down on the toilet.\n\n\u201cI have to pee so bad,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re getting water all over the place!\u201d\n\n\u201cSorry. I usually shave in the shower, but this isn\u2019t going very well.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell hold on,\u201d she said, giving her pussy a quick wipe with a wad of toilet paper, \u201cI\u2019ll help.\u201d\n\nThen she stood up and crammed into the shower with me and held her hand out, so I gave her the razor. Her shower is really tight. It\u2019s just a one-person stand-up stall, definitely not intended for two people. So we were skin on skin, and I was trying to get far enough away from her so she could maneuver her arms, and it turned out the best way to do that was to lean our backs against the walls with our legs stretched out, but to do that they had to be intertwined so she was straddling one of my thighs. She is a little shorter than me, so her pussy was right on my leg.\n\nShe started carefully shaving my face with the razor. She was so gentle. It reminded me of how gentle she had been yesterday when she had rubbed sunscreen on my cock. I started to get hard thinking about it. I was actively trying not to, because this was not my objective for my shower at all, but there we were. She was concentrating so hard on shaving my face that she didn\u2019t notice until she was satisfied with her work, rinsed the razor off for the last time while feeling my face for smoothness with her other hand, and then went to reach across to put the razor on the little bathroom counter and she brushed my rock hard cock with her other hand.\n\n\u201cDave!\u201d She said, looking down at my throbbing cock. \u201cDoes shaving make you horny or something?\u201d She started laughing.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t help it! It just happens.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just kidding. Here, I\u2019ll wash it for you. That should give you a thrill.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, Amy, really,\u201d I started, but she had already squirt a little soap on her hands and was rubbing them together. She gently caressed my cock with the soap for a few seconds, rubbing my balls, gently stroking the shaft a few times.\n\n\u201cSee? Totally normal,\u201d she said through a fit of giggles.\n\n\u201cNow do me,\u201d she said, and turned around, and pushed her ass out slightly with her palms flat against the wall. I squirt some soap in my hand from the dispenser on the wall, rubbed my hands together a bit, and then reached one hand around to her pussy while I slid the other down the crack of her ass until I felt her asshole. I slowly rubbed each area for a few seconds, and then that was that.\n\n\u201cOk quick, move. I have to rinse this off fast otherwise it burns.\u201d\n\nAmy pushed me out of the way, and I figured we were done with shower time anyway, so I got out and dried off while she finished washing her hair. We started our day without any further incident, which was strangely fine with me. Had it been a girlfriend of mine, I would have fucked her right then and there, but this whole thing is different.\n\nThat day we went to Haulover Beach again. This time it wasn\u2019t weird at all. We got there and took our clothes off like it was no big deal. I rubbed sunscreen on my own dick this time. I didn\u2019t really get a boner, though it did feel exhilarating to walk down to the water this time. The ocean was really warm and we floated in the waves a bit. Being naked in the ocean feels really different.\n\nThat night we went to a hookah lounge for dinner called Oasis. Neither one of us has a fake ID, so we cannot drink when we go out, so bars can be a little boring unless there is live music or something. This place was kind of cool. They bring hookahs to your table. The food was pretty good.\n\nThere was a group of guys at a table next to us that kept looking at Amy. I mentioned it and she turned to look at them and smiled and waved, exactly the way she might smile and wave to you while sitting on the toilet. To the untrained eye, it probably doesn\u2019t look sarcastic.\n\nAnyway, then a funny thing happened. Amy grabbed her purse and went to the restroom, and while she was gone, the guys went into \u201cbro mode\u201d turning around to me with this line: \u201cYou\u2019re a lucky man.\u201d Then another dude chimed in with, \u201cYeah bro. Definitely a keeper.\u201d They were in their early twenties, not drunk yet, so probably not dangerous. I honestly got the impression they were just being complimentary.\n\nThen I said, \u201cThanks man, but she\u2019s my sister.\u201d Then there was some more witty remarks, but nothing offensive.\n\nWhen Amy came back, the guys were now a little more overt. The guys with their backs to her were turning around and glancing a bit. The check came, and one of the guys who had talked to me before said, \u201cYou\u2019re not already leaving are you?\u201d But he said it to Amy and not to me. Then Amy came and sat on my side of the table so we were both facing them, put her arms around my neck and gave me a kiss on the cheek and said, \u201cYeah, sorry. I can\u2019t wait to take this guy home and see what happens.\u201d\n\nThere were some confused looks on their faces as I quickly signed the check and we hurried out. In the car I explained to her that her fake boyfriend ploy probably looked strange because I had already told them she was my sister. We both laughed about it all the way home.\n\nSo we got back to her place and when we got inside the door I expected her to dump her clothes on the floor as usual, but instead she sat on the bed and beckoned me over. I stood in front of her and she reached out to undo the button on my jeans and unzipped them and tugged at the sides. I helped her by pushing them down, along with my boxers. I pulled my shirt off over my head and I started to get hard. There is something erotic about being fully naked in front of a girl who is fully clothed. I can\u2019t really explain it. But Amy wasn\u2019t looking at my cock. She was looking into my eyes.\n\n\u201cI have a surprise for you,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cOh? What\u2019s that?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll show you,\u201d she said, a mischievous grin spreading across her face. Then she gently pushed me back so she could stand up. She steadied herself with her hand on my shoulder while she pulled her sandals off and then turned around with her ass to me and raised her arms in the air. I took the cue and pulled her flowy little dress up over her head and tossed it on the floor next to the bed. Then she slowly crawled onto the bed with her ass toward me, and there was a pink jeweled butt plug in her ass. She looked over her shoulder and smiled and wiggled her ass playfully.\n\nShe knew exactly what she was doing. A year ago I had told her a story about my then-girlfriend who wore a buttplug the first time we hooked up and I had told Amy it was really hot. That was the only girl that had ever been adventurous in that department, and it remains a highlight of my admittedly short sexual career.\n\n\u201cAmy!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou like it?\u201d She giggled, arching her back a little more, sticking her butt higher in the air.\n\n\u201cOh my God,\u201d I said. She laughed.\n\n\u201cI stuck it in my ass when I went to the restroom at the hookah place.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh my God,\u201d I said again. I was just staring at her pussy with that little pink jewel in her ass.\n\n\u201cYou want to come check it out?\u201d She asked. \u201cIt\u2019s about time to co-masturbate, I think.\u201d At that we both laughed.\n\nI kneeled my way onto the bed, my hard cock glistening at the tip with precum, and she crawled forward a bit. I didn\u2019t know exactly what to do but just look at it.\n\nShe reached a hand between her legs and started slowly rubbing her clit. It was mesmerizing.\n\n\u201cYou can touch it if you want,\u201d she said quietly.\n\n\u201cI can? Like how?\u201d\n\n\u201cLike any way you want,\u201d she said, closing her eyes slowly and concentrating on other things. She then assumed her preferred position for getting off, and her butt cheeks closed around her butt plug a bit. I reached out with my thumb and forefinger and gently tugged on the jewel. Amy moaned softly. Then I pulled on it a little more firmly and her asshole clenched a bit. Then I pushed on it. After a while we fell into a rhythm. While she was slowly grinding her pussy against her hands, I was gently fucking her asshole with her shiny metal buttplug. She started moving faster, and the plug slipped out and I dropped it on the bed and it bounced and rolled onto the floor.\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d She moaned jokingly, \u201cI was so close!\u201d\n\nWithout thinking about it, I immediately pushed my finger into her asshole. She flipped her head around to look at me over her shoulder, and when our eyes met she smiled and pushed her ass against my finger, burying it deeper, then closed her eyes and buried her face in the pillow. Now she was fucking my finger with her asshole while grinding her pussy against her hand. It was less than a minute later that she stopped and whispered, \u201cFeel me cum.\u201d Her asshole contracted around my finger several times as she collapsed on the bed. It was the hottest thing I have ever experienced, and I am pretty sure I haven\u2019t even seen a porno that was more perfectly sexy.\n\n\u201cOh my God. That was the best orgasm I\u2019ve ever had.\u201d She said it into the pillow, so it was muffled. Then she started giggling and alternately taking deep breaths and exhaling. I leaned back against some pillows against the wall and just looked at her. After a minute she pushed herself up on all fours, turned around to face me and said, \u201cYour turn?\u201d\n\n\u201cI am NOT sticking that thing in my ass,\u201d I said, and we both laughed.\n\nShe layed down on her stomach, elbows on the bed, her chin in her hands, just inches from my hard cock, staring at it.\n\n\u201cI just want to watch you,\u201d she said. \u201cIs that ok?\u201d\n\nWithout saying anything, I grabbed my cock by the shaft and started slowly stroking it. She was staring at my dick, I\u2019d like to say admiringly, but it might have been more like simple fascination. We were quiet, and I was just doing my thing. She occasionally looked up at me, but mostly was just staring at my cock as I slowly stroked it. I eventually closed my eyes and leaned my head back against the wall. Then I felt her warm little hand gently cup my balls and knead them slowly while I continued stroking my cock. I never do that to myself, and let me tell you, it felt amazing. I didn\u2019t open my eyes. I started stroking faster and I felt an orgasm building.\n\n\u201cYou want to watch me cum?\u201d I whispered through short breaths.\n\n\u201cYes, cum for me,\u201d she whispered back. And with that I felt her other hand grab the shaft of my cock below mine and gently squeeze it. I moaned in approval. Then seconds before I was about to come, she gently pushed my hand away and I opened my eyes and looked down to see her flipping her hair to one side as she took my cock in her mouth and sucked it slowly for a few seconds before I exploded into her mouth. I couldn\u2019t believe what I was seeing, and it felt amazing. She sucked gently, swallowing my cum until the last twitch of my cock. She looked up at me and smiled.\n\n\u201cAmy. Jesus Christ.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to do that, but it always seemed gross.\u201d\n\n\u201cOhhhkaaaay,\u201d I said, closing my eyes and trying to recover from that amazing orgasm.\n\n\u201cIt just seemed like the right thing to do,\u201d she said simply. \u201cI hope you don\u2019t mind.\u201d Her face showed no actual concern. In fact, she was grinning because she knew damn well I didn\u2019t mind. It was the most appropriate reciprocal action to me sticking my finger up her ass. I knew why it made perfect sense in her mind.\n\n\u201cThis is turning out to be a really interesting weekend,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cI know. We\u2019re going to have to plan another visit soon.\u201d She winked at me and then bounded off of the bed to the bathroom.",

It is nice to know internet strangers are kind and thoughtful, however perverted they may be!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On that point, while my name does happen to be David, my sister\u2019s is not Amy. While we did grow up near a major airport hub, it was not Chicago, and while I am going to school on the west coast, it is not U of A. (It was my favorite, but I did not get accepted, thank you very much.) I think I fictionalized enough of the actual details that some crazy person is not going to dox me.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For the internet supersleuth asking how she lives off campus, you can pretty much always get an exemption at every school I have heard of. In her case, housing is impacted, so they give you an option. Please don\u2019t ask me whether it was lottery or random selection or what form was submitted. If you cannot suspend your disbelief of what you read on the internet long enough to concede this reasonable truth, then don\u2019t read things on the internet, I guess.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yes, I have an interest in writing. I am probably going to go with English when I have to declare my major. More than your pervy comments, (which are totally fine, btw; I posted to a pervy sub) I really appreciate your input on my writing specifically. Honestly, I cannot tell if I am a good writer, and receiving feedback (however weird it may be to come from this forum) is greatly appreciated. On this point I must admit: I am writing this dialog from my paraphrased memory of the actual events to make it into a story for your enjoyment. Some dialog is verbatim as I remember it. Some just conveys what happened.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Someone sent me a DM that this story sounded \u201chonest.\u201d I frankly don\u2019t think I am THAT good of a writer that I could just make this shit up. If it seems honest, it is likely because it really happened. If you don\u2019t want to believe it, that is totally cool. Getting this out in an anonymous forum is my only therapy on the matter, so I\u2019m really doing this more for me than for you.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lastly, no, I am not going to send a picture of my sister\u2019s naked body. I don\u2019t even want something like that on my phone, much less the internet.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;With all that out of the way, let me continue...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Amy got up to pee. With the door open. I sat on the bed and watched her while she sat on the toilet. She smiled and waved at me. I smiled and shook my head. She came back and sat on the bed again, facing me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI guess we should talk about that,\u201d she said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cYa think?\u201d We both laughed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cSo...\u201d I started, but didn\u2019t really know where to go with it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cRight,\u201d she said. \u201cThat was definitely sexual.\u201d She giggled and patted my knee. \u201cBut not, like, between us. Does that make sense?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWe just co-masturbated,\u201d I said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She laughed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cYeah but,\u201d she said, \u201cLike, why do you think it wasn\u2019t weird?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWe continue to disagree on the meaning of the term weird.\u201d We both laughed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I understood what she meant. Being a twin is a thing a lot of people cannot relate to. You grow up never really feeling like you are an individual. I know other twins \u2013 identicals \u2013 for whom this is a much bigger deal. Their DNA is identical. Think about that. You are never really your own person. You are always defined as one of a pair. Your pictures from your childhood have you in the same outfits. People call you \u201cthe twins.\u201d You can either embrace it or reject it. I have heard of twins that have sour relationships in part because they had to exert their independence from each other to feel like an individual.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For Amy and me, it was the opposite. We never had to compete for attention or anything like that. Maybe because she is a girl, we never really fought the way two boys might. In fact, it was always really comforting for both of us that we had each other. It is very much like having an extension of yourself. Our relationship has always been more honest because we never felt like there was any chance of betrayal because you wouldn\u2019t betray yourself, you know? Anyway, we have shared a lot of intimate details over the years, from as long as I can remember. Embarrassing things you may never tell a soul, we would readily confide in each other about. There are things we know about each other that we will take to the grave. Advice on everything under the sun was always a short conversation away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is for all these reasons that I understood what she meant by all this not being weird. It is because she feels as comfortable with me regarding literally everything as I do with her. After your sister has driven to bring you a change of clothes after you accidentally shit your pants at work, there is not much that is off limits. (That is a true story, and it just pained me deeply to recall that memory and write that sentence.) After you have been the only person she would trust to carefully examine her butthole because it was itchy and she was afraid it was something horrible, nothing feels like you cannot go there. Simply put, we have been \u201cbros\u201d for so long, had each other\u2019s backs so many times, and been so intimately intertwined for so long, that I totally understood what she was trying to say. Jerking off alone is totally normal. Jerking off with someone who feels like an extension of yourself, while maybe not totally normal, is also not out of the realm of reason.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI know what you mean,\u201d I said. \u201cI feel like I should feel guilty for violating some major taboo, but I don\u2019t at all.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cRight! That\u2019s what I\u2019m saying. Even though that was obviously sexual, it just felt like we were doing it together. But not with each other.\u201d She looked at me, and I was smirking and she laughed and hit my leg playfully.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI\u2019m not explaining this very well,\u201d she said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cNo, yes you are,\u201d I said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cYou\u2019re my brother, but you\u2019re like my best friend. But it\u2019s more than that.\u201d She was looking at the wall over my shoulder, searching for words.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cIt\u2019s like you\u2019re me,\u201d I said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cRight, yeah,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel as comfortable around you as I do myself. I literally don\u2019t feel a difference. There are married couples who never pee in front of each other, but we\u2019ve always been totally open with each other about everything.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She stood looking at me for a few moments, and then added, \u201cI hope this doesn\u2019t sound wrong, but the reason I know this isn\u2019t weird is because I don\u2019t want to have sex with you.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I didn\u2019t realize it until she said it, but that was exactly why it wasn\u2019t weird. There was no lust, no longing, no unrequited love or anything that would feel deeply confusing. We just got off together. We had walked in on each other several times in the past doing the exact same thing, and it wasn\u2019t some big deal that was totally embarrassing. In fact, I am surprised that we didn\u2019t do something like that way back when puberty was hitting, just to experiment together, because that is something we totally would have done.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWait that might have come out wrong,\u201d she said, and then started giggling.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cNo, no,\u201d I said. \u201cYou just put your finger on it. Other people probably couldn\u2019t understand because they don\u2019t have our history together, but you\u2019re right. This doesn\u2019t feel one bit illicit.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cRight,\u201d She said, \u201cSo we\u2019re good.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWe\u2019re good,\u201d I said. \u201cWe\u2019re weird, but we\u2019re good.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then she leaned in and hugged me while we were both laughing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cSo now what?\u201d She asked, after we had pulled apart.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI mean, I guess we stay naked and randomly masturbate when the mood strikes?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She hit me with a pillow and said, \u201cYep that about sums it up!\u201d Then she was still smiling when she said, \u201cI\u2019ve really got the greatest brother.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We fell asleep that night holding hands. The next morning I woke up and she was gone. There was a text on my phone that she had gone for a jog, so I got up and took a shower. I had only been in the shower a couple minutes when she came home. I have a little mirror in my shower, but she doesn\u2019t. So I was trying to shave by hanging out the shower and looking in the bathroom mirror. She had stripped her clothes off at the door as usual and came in the bathroom and sat down on the toilet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI have to pee so bad,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re getting water all over the place!\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cSorry. I usually shave in the shower, but this isn\u2019t going very well.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWell hold on,\u201d she said, giving her pussy a quick wipe with a wad of toilet paper, \u201cI\u2019ll help.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then she stood up and crammed into the shower with me and held her hand out, so I gave her the razor. Her shower is really tight. It\u2019s just a one-person stand-up stall, definitely not intended for two people. So we were skin on skin, and I was trying to get far enough away from her so she could maneuver her arms, and it turned out the best way to do that was to lean our backs against the walls with our legs stretched out, but to do that they had to be intertwined so she was straddling one of my thighs. She is a little shorter than me, so her pussy was right on my leg.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She started carefully shaving my face with the razor. She was so gentle. It reminded me of how gentle she had been yesterday when she had rubbed sunscreen on my cock. I started to get hard thinking about it. I was actively trying not to, because this was not my objective for my shower at all, but there we were. She was concentrating so hard on shaving my face that she didn\u2019t notice until she was satisfied with her work, rinsed the razor off for the last time while feeling my face for smoothness with her other hand, and then went to reach across to put the razor on the little bathroom counter and she brushed my rock hard cock with her other hand.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cDave!\u201d She said, looking down at my throbbing cock. \u201cDoes shaving make you horny or something?\u201d She started laughing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI can\u2019t help it! It just happens.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI\u2019m just kidding. Here, I\u2019ll wash it for you. That should give you a thrill.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cNo, Amy, really,\u201d I started, but she had already squirt a little soap on her hands and was rubbing them together. She gently caressed my cock with the soap for a few seconds, rubbing my balls, gently stroking the shaft a few times.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cSee? Totally normal,\u201d she said through a fit of giggles.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cNow do me,\u201d she said, and turned around, and pushed her ass out slightly with her palms flat against the wall. I squirt some soap in my hand from the dispenser on the wall, rubbed my hands together a bit, and then reached one hand around to her pussy while I slid the other down the crack of her ass until I felt her asshole. I slowly rubbed each area for a few seconds, and then that was that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cOk quick, move. I have to rinse this off fast otherwise it burns.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Amy pushed me out of the way, and I figured we were done with shower time anyway, so I got out and dried off while she finished washing her hair. We started our day without any further incident, which was strangely fine with me. Had it been a girlfriend of mine, I would have fucked her right then and there, but this whole thing is different.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That day we went to Haulover Beach again. This time it wasn\u2019t weird at all. We got there and took our clothes off like it was no big deal. I rubbed sunscreen on my own dick this time. I didn\u2019t really get a boner, though it did feel exhilarating to walk down to the water this time. The ocean was really warm and we floated in the waves a bit. Being naked in the ocean feels really different.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That night we went to a hookah lounge for dinner called Oasis. Neither one of us has a fake ID, so we cannot drink when we go out, so bars can be a little boring unless there is live music or something. This place was kind of cool. They bring hookahs to your table. The food was pretty good.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There was a group of guys at a table next to us that kept looking at Amy. I mentioned it and she turned to look at them and smiled and waved, exactly the way she might smile and wave to you while sitting on the toilet. To the untrained eye, it probably doesn\u2019t look sarcastic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, then a funny thing happened. Amy grabbed her purse and went to the restroom, and while she was gone, the guys went into \u201cbro mode\u201d turning around to me with this line: \u201cYou\u2019re a lucky man.\u201d Then another dude chimed in with, \u201cYeah bro. Definitely a keeper.\u201d They were in their early twenties, not drunk yet, so probably not dangerous. I honestly got the impression they were just being complimentary.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then I said, \u201cThanks man, but she\u2019s my sister.\u201d Then there was some more witty remarks, but nothing offensive.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When Amy came back, the guys were now a little more overt. The guys with their backs to her were turning around and glancing a bit. The check came, and one of the guys who had talked to me before said, \u201cYou\u2019re not already leaving are you?\u201d But he said it to Amy and not to me. Then Amy came and sat on my side of the table so we were both facing them, put her arms around my neck and gave me a kiss on the cheek and said, \u201cYeah, sorry. I can\u2019t wait to take this guy home and see what happens.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There were some confused looks on their faces as I quickly signed the check and we hurried out. In the car I explained to her that her fake boyfriend ploy probably looked strange because I had already told them she was my sister. We both laughed about it all the way home.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So we got back to her place and when we got inside the door I expected her to dump her clothes on the floor as usual, but instead she sat on the bed and beckoned me over. I stood in front of her and she reached out to undo the button on my jeans and unzipped them and tugged at the sides. I helped her by pushing them down, along with my boxers. I pulled my shirt off over my head and I started to get hard. There is something erotic about being fully naked in front of a girl who is fully clothed. I can\u2019t really explain it. But Amy wasn\u2019t looking at my cock. She was looking into my eyes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI have a surprise for you,\u201d she said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cOh? What\u2019s that?\u201d I asked.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI\u2019ll show you,\u201d she said, a mischievous grin spreading across her face. Then she gently pushed me back so she could stand up. She steadied herself with her hand on my shoulder while she pulled her sandals off and then turned around with her ass to me and raised her arms in the air. I took the cue and pulled her flowy little dress up over her head and tossed it on the floor next to the bed. Then she slowly crawled onto the bed with her ass toward me, and there was a pink jeweled butt plug in her ass. She looked over her shoulder and smiled and wiggled her ass playfully.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She knew exactly what she was doing. A year ago I had told her a story about my then-girlfriend who wore a buttplug the first time we hooked up and I had told Amy it was really hot. That was the only girl that had ever been adventurous in that department, and it remains a highlight of my admittedly short sexual career.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cAmy!\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cYou like it?\u201d She giggled, arching her back a little more, sticking her butt higher in the air.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cOh my God,\u201d I said. She laughed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI stuck it in my ass when I went to the restroom at the hookah place.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cOh my God,\u201d I said again. I was just staring at her pussy with that little pink jewel in her ass.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cYou want to come check it out?\u201d She asked. \u201cIt\u2019s about time to co-masturbate, I think.\u201d At that we both laughed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I kneeled my way onto the bed, my hard cock glistening at the tip with precum, and she crawled forward a bit. I didn\u2019t know exactly what to do but just look at it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She reached a hand between her legs and started slowly rubbing her clit. It was mesmerizing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cYou can touch it if you want,\u201d she said quietly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI can? Like how?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cLike any way you want,\u201d she said, closing her eyes slowly and concentrating on other things. She then assumed her preferred position for getting off, and her butt cheeks closed around her butt plug a bit. I reached out with my thumb and forefinger and gently tugged on the jewel. Amy moaned softly. Then I pulled on it a little more firmly and her asshole clenched a bit. Then I pushed on it. After a while we fell into a rhythm. While she was slowly grinding her pussy against her hands, I was gently fucking her asshole with her shiny metal buttplug. She started moving faster, and the plug slipped out and I dropped it on the bed and it bounced and rolled onto the floor.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cNo!\u201d She moaned jokingly, \u201cI was so close!\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Without thinking about it, I immediately pushed my finger into her asshole. She flipped her head around to look at me over her shoulder, and when our eyes met she smiled and pushed her ass against my finger, burying it deeper, then closed her eyes and buried her face in the pillow. Now she was fucking my finger with her asshole while grinding her pussy against her hand. It was less than a minute later that she stopped and whispered, \u201cFeel me cum.\u201d Her asshole contracted around my finger several times as she collapsed on the bed. It was the hottest thing I have ever experienced, and I am pretty sure I haven\u2019t even seen a porno that was more perfectly sexy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cOh my God. That was the best orgasm I\u2019ve ever had.\u201d She said it into the pillow, so it was muffled. Then she started giggling and alternately taking deep breaths and exhaling. I leaned back against some pillows against the wall and just looked at her. After a minute she pushed herself up on all fours, turned around to face me and said, \u201cYour turn?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI am NOT sticking that thing in my ass,\u201d I said, and we both laughed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She layed down on her stomach, elbows on the bed, her chin in her hands, just inches from my hard cock, staring at it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI just want to watch you,\u201d she said. \u201cIs that ok?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Without saying anything, I grabbed my cock by the shaft and started slowly stroking it. She was staring at my dick, I\u2019d like to say admiringly, but it might have been more like simple fascination. We were quiet, and I was just doing my thing. She occasionally looked up at me, but mostly was just staring at my cock as I slowly stroked it. I eventually closed my eyes and leaned my head back against the wall. Then I felt her warm little hand gently cup my balls and knead them slowly while I continued stroking my cock. I never do that to myself, and let me tell you, it felt amazing. I didn\u2019t open my eyes. I started stroking faster and I felt an orgasm building.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cYou want to watch me cum?\u201d I whispered through short breaths.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cYes, cum for me,\u201d she whispered back. And with that I felt her other hand grab the shaft of my cock below mine and gently squeeze it. I moaned in approval. Then seconds before I was about to come, she gently pushed my hand away and I opened my eyes and looked down to see her flipping her hair to one side as she took my cock in her mouth and sucked it slowly for a few seconds before I exploded into her mouth. I couldn\u2019t believe what I was seeing, and it felt amazing. She sucked gently, swallowing my cum until the last twitch of my cock. She looked up at me and smiled.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cAmy. Jesus Christ.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to do that, but it always seemed gross.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cOhhhkaaaay,\u201d I said, closing my eyes and trying to recover from that amazing orgasm.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cIt just seemed like the right thing to do,\u201d she said simply. \u201cI hope you don\u2019t mind.\u201d Her face showed no actual concern. In fact, she was grinning because she knew damn well I didn\u2019t mind. It was the most appropriate reciprocal action to me sticking my finger up her ass. I knew why it made perfect sense in her mind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cThis is turning out to be a really interesting weekend,\u201d I said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI know. We\u2019re going to have to plan another visit soon.\u201d She winked at me and then bounded off of the bed to the bathroom.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
