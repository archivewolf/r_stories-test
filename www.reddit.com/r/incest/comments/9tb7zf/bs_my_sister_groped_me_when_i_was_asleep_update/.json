I came down for a snack around 7pm and saw her watching TV in the living room. My parents had left for their dinner date so I decided to confront her about what happened. I started with just making small talk, and I was met with short curt answers, so I then just got to the point and told I that I have noticed her acting different around me lately. Immediately she looked down and away from me, so I knew she knew what I was talking about. I then told her I was worried about her and that if she needs to get something off her chest or wants to talk about something that I would be more than willing to listen. I promised that no matter what it was I would still love her and not judge her and be as supportive as I could. She didn\u2019t say anything for a few seconds, then she told me that she was fine and just having a hard time in school, and that she was sorry if she started taking it out on me. I knew she was lying, of course, but I didn\u2019t want to pressure her. I decided to leave it at that for the night and ask again tomorrow, since my parents would be out all day doing whatever it is people do on their anniversaries. I told her that I understand, and that my offer still stood to hear her out if she needed to tell me anything, and I restated that I would promise not to judge and that I would be as supportive as I could. \n\nTurns out that I didn\u2019t need to wait till tomorrow. She came into my room around 1ish (my parents got home at 9ish and went to bed at 10ish) and asked if she could talk to me. I was just playing video games at the time, so I told her of course and paused the game. She told me that she had been thinking about what I said and that she was lying earlier about just having a hard time in school and said that she did need to talk to me about something. I told her that I\u2019m always here for her if she needs me, and then she started to cry. I was not expecting her to just burst out in tears like that. I went and sat down on my bed next to her and hugged her to try and comfort her. She started crying on my shoulder. A good 5 minutes passed before she pulled herself together, apologized for crying on my shoulder, and actually told me what was going on. She began by telling me that the only romantic experience she has ever had with a boy had been a bad one. She said that her first and only boyfriend (they were both in 9th grade at the time) had made unwanted advances on her and when she refused them he spat on her and called her a bitch. Of course as soon as she said that I offered to hunt this little shit down and strangle him, but she told me her friends took care of it. She then told me how ever since then she just didn\u2019t want to get romantically involved with boys again for fear of that happening again, and that she started thinking about me a lot because I was always nice to her and supportive of her. She told me that the more she thought about how I was always there for her, the more her loved for me developed into more than a sisterly one. After telling me this, I stopped her and asked why she never acted this way before a few days ago. She told me that she felt guilty for the feelings she had developed for me and that she was constantly trying, and for the most part succeeding, to ignore them. She said that the tipping point was the study group I had at my place (I\u2019m part of a study group for my calc II class, and we usually hold our meetings at somebody else\u2019s house, but they weren\u2019t available so we had it at my place). She told me that she started to feel jealous and annoyed of one particular girl in the group who is flirty with me, and how after the meeting she couldn\u2019t hide her feelings for me anymore and couldn\u2019t stop thinking about how I could be romantically involved with her, which is what made her start acting that way. \n\nI was stunned. She had felt a sexual love for me since 9th grade and I was completely clueless about it. After a few seconds of me processing what she just told me and thinking about what I should do next, I decided to confront her about her groping me. I asked her if these feelings were why she payed me a late night visit. Immediately she got red and the face and profusely apologized. After her apology, she told me that ever since the study group meeting she had been feeling scared that I was going to get stolen away from her and that all of her feelings mixing together just led her to being unable to control herself. \n\nAfter telling me all of this, I had to sit back and process. I was so surprised at what I was hearing, because all this time I truly had no idea of these feelings she had for me. After about 30 seconds of me being quiet, she started to tear up and say how she knew I would be disgusted with her and that she never should have told me. I hugged her again and told her I wasn\u2019t disgusted with her and I still love and care about her. After that we just sat there hugging for a couple more minutes before we finally broke apart and she asked me how I felt about all of this. After gathering my thoughts, I told her that I was surprised to find out she had felt this way about me since 9th grade. I told her again that I\u2019m not disgusted with her and I still love her, but I\u2019m not sure how I should respond for the feelings she has for me. We went quiet for a while before she stood up and said that whatever my response is, she was relieved that I don\u2019t hate her now and she feels like a huge weight has been lifted off of her since she told me her feelings. We hugged again before she told me she would let me think about it. I told her I would think about everything and would talk to her about this again when I was ready, then she left and went to her room. \n\nI feel hugely relieved that she\u2019s ok and nothing is wrong with her. Now the only question remains is how I respond to her feelings. As I\u2019ve said before, I have never felt anything towards her other than a brotherly love, but after she groped me I have started to look at her differently. I have found myself wondering if a relationship between us could work and fantasizing about her in a sexual way. She obviously wants to pursue an intimate relationship with me, but I still don\u2019t know if that\u2019s a good idea. I know for a fact my family would not be supportive of a relationship like that at all. We would have to keep it hidden, and personally I don\u2019t feel like hidden relationships like that are healthy.\n\nI will update what happened after this when the 12 hour period is over. ",

We are all people. But we are excited to marry a stranger live with them have baby die. Also the human being creates stronger pheromones when engaging in regular sex and there are many forms of love. \n\nYou are right having opened your eyes and not rejecting the idea outright is something that would or wouldn't happen. If you think of her as just a regular girl confessing her love to you since the 9th grade. But you were her good friend and it could ruin your relationship with other friends or knowing your friend was after them. So many different things happen but as soon as it is family member label is there. It's like someone falling in love with a person for year to find out they are of the same sex, and not being able to just turn those feelings off. She would have gone through hell and back yelling at herself I've read similar stories. The first thing we try to do is protect the one we love from this overly forced structure, and the pain of losing them with rejection. \n\nShe has spent a long time and come to realize what it is she wants, I don't think that will ever go away. You need to think without the crap of people, imagine if you dated a person and they hit your parents for something they may have done or said, but you couldn't no matter what they screamed at you too not be with them. Some may think a bad experience happened all she needs is a better outlook on dating and there are plenty others. WELL ... not everyone just goes ah this turned bad I want to be with my brother. It doesn't work like that, like I said sometimes we see what is hidden in plain sight, not everyone wants to start a Related Relationship. As it causes problems just like Gay people or Trans you can run and play house but it always catches you off guard. I used to work and stay busy and never relaxed. Either at work studies a whole day just to escape from my own ideas that caused me to look into it and saw something inspiring, In my case it was; Just Fuck It and then I became searching to become a trans woman, used my mom's name she would have named me so everything was a new me. The old me died the name sounds strange my old pictures like a dream.\n\nBut anything doing in this world is never easy, you must work for it. The better it is the harder you must work. If you live in a place where it is Illegal it can be an issue if you can't move to a place not. You should also know that nearly everything you think you know about what most call Incestuous relationships, honesty I prefer Relative or Related Relationships. There is nothing wrong developing feelings for someone as it is up the the couple to decide what happens. Thinking there is no future is wrong. Also thinking you couldn't make her happy like what they have monopolized as a normal relationship, is just your brain running away from something different. I doesn't have to stay a lie not everyone will be happy, but if you both move out together then you don't need to keep it a secret. \n\nBut she has extreme trust in you, to Express her what she feels shame for feeling you need to let her know that there is nothing to be shameful. Maybe ask her to elaborate about her gaze set to you, and if you did want a relationship what would you expect out of it. How could it be done as while you live at home it may have to remain a secret. Also thinking that you will make deformed babies is the best scare tactic, I will tell you as many know it's just genetic problems that a female may carry, or certain conditions cause abnormal birth defects but it is common in everyone. It only becomes a problem when it happens throughout generations. But there are many happy couples that live normal lifestyles. \n\nI'm not telling you what to do just don't run away and hide under the blanket of how your life is ment to go. Maybe you could try just hanging around her more like just playing games and TV. Not doing anything just as if she was a friend get to know who she is if you don't have that close type relationship. That way you both have an idea of what it could be like. Also if she respects your wishes she shouldn't try anything more than maybe wanting too cuddle and watch TV. Seeing that you are still confused as most would be trying to break the idea of all the fight to be with someone. But if you can visualize her without wanting to vomit or feel gross. \n\nQuite some stories I've read that they have just agreed to a sexual relationship and it continues even after they are married. Or they get married and end up getting together. \n\nBut talking about everything together is very important, as she doesn't sound like she is forcing you into anything she seems to feel bad that she has now caused someone she loves very much pain and anxiety with everything. Also guilty for feeling that way she may seem stable but she is terrified of rejection it is why I mentioned if you aren't sure it's best to just be around the person more. Try to ignore the title sister or brother. I'm not sure if you want permission or and easy escape from this. But love isn't easy you have to work hard for it. Letting her know that you will hang out more often or other ideas you have of testing your feelings. \n\nA simple kiss was how I could tell if you can engage in a kiss it may help. Just don't think with your dick. Honestly slow is best especially if she had a bad experience so she won't hurry anything. Maybe asking to sleep next to you and cuddle, while you think. \n\nAs for being together may cause problems I've heard of an older couple that after a really bad episode of violent after she broke the engagement off because he hit her. But something happened I don't remember the whole story it was a great tale as they came out to everyone friends workers. They said hey shut down Facebook as some relatives were un happy it was half and half. But he was away flying while the ex forced the ring from her months later and asked why she left and who for. He went mental on her being home alone called her parents, called cops he got a restraining order on him and at the start when telling the parents the mom wasn't happy but accepted their decision the dad hated it.
