I must point out that I'm still not sexually attracted to her, and most of what I said is an attempt to make her more self confidant.\n\nIt's was sunday morning and she called me for breakfast.\n\nShe was wearing just her lingerie. I told her we should have a serious conversation, but first she would listen to me.\n\n(My speech probably wasn't 100% accurate with what I'm writing now, mostly considering the fact that I'm translating what I said, but the general idea is here)\n\n*\"So, I want you to know that I've noticed you. I'm not blind. I'm a man. And you're a woman, and an attractive woman at that.*\n\n*I understand what you're doing, I really do. You want to feel desired. I do the same. Why do you think I go to the gym and keep a diet? Because I like? Fuck no, is so that women desire me. I'm ok with what you're doing and you should do it more often and with whoever you want to desire you: me, other men, women, whatever makes you happy.*\n\n*But you gotta understand, first of all, I'm your father. And, even worse, I also act like your mother. That's why I never brought any woman home, that's why I never had any serious relation. You're the most important person to me and I don't want anyone meddling in our relation or, even worse, mistreating you. With that said, I'm also a man, I have urges and so I will go out with women and fuck them.*\n\n*You know what I think about sex: Consenting adults can do whatever the fuck they want in their private lives. What I never said is that I also believe that this also includes family members.*\n\n*So, we have to make a decision. If that's what you really want, I'll start treating you like a woman. I've never seen you sexually until recently, but we can try it, see if it works, as I said you're an attractive woman. But you gotta understand. I'm a different man like that, I will not be as kind and gentle as I'm with you now. We also have to consider that we'll have to hide it. Society will not accept it, even our own family.*\n\n*If not, also ok. And I'm also ok with you fooling around with me, I'll even play along. BUT* \\*I raised my hand and my voice\\* *you have to understand, I'll not stop dating other woman. I'm the one who decides about my sex life, you are free to comment and even try counsel me about it, but it's I alone that decides with who I have sex. And, most importantly, the reverse also applies.\"*\n\nI got her by surprise, she dint had an answer to nothing, she just stood still in the chair in front of me, mouth slightly open in silence.\n\nI stood up, sat on her side. Tears forming in her eyes (to be sincere, I also wanted to cry, scream, *PLEASE, GOD, JUST LET IT END*). I embraced her, give her a kiss on the cheek, grabbed my bowl and got up again. There were already tears rolling in her cheek.\n\n*\"I understand, it's to much. I'll give you a time to think by yourself. When you want to talk to me, I'll be in my room.\"*\n\nAnd left to my bedroom.\n\nIt took about half an hour, she knocked on my door and I said to come in. She had put on a shirt now (an anime t-shirt to be exact, at first was quite hard to take her seriously with that). Her eyes were red from the tears. I told her to sit by my side on the bed. She hugged me, I embraced her back. She started sobbing, partially muffled by my chest. Her head under my chin. We stood like that for some five minutes. I could feel my shirt getting wet from her tears.\n\nI raised her chin up, kissed her forehead, then said: *\"It's okay sweetie, whatever you have to say, I'll be there for you.\"*\n\nAfter some more sobbing, she started talking.\n\nShe first asked me to forgive her, It was not her intention to meddle in my particular life. Although I call 100% bullshit on that, I said it was ok, there was nothing to be forgiven. That I understand that I'm also important to her and, deep inside, she also wanted the best for me (again 100% bullshit, I'm positive that she was trying to at least manipulate my sex life).\n\nThen I asked her why she was trying to seduce me, at first she was very defensive, saying it was just a game, just for fun. I pressed her a little harder on that subject and some serious facts came to light. I will keep that just between us, it is a very sensitive subject, that I don't want to share.\n\nAfter that I lied on the bed. It was a shock for me and I was emotionally shaken and unstable. She lied next to me, cuddling on my chest as I hugged her.\n\nWe stood like that in silence for some time, certainly more than an hour. But still, I had to address the elephant in the room.\n\n*\"So... All that flirting, the jealousy... Are you really attracted to me?  If so, as I said, I'm ok with that...\"*\n\nWhat happened then took me totally off guard, I just stood there baffled as it happened. As I was talking, she stood above me, grabbed my head and kissed me mid sentence. A romantic kiss, on my lips. At first I didn't do nothing, as I said, completely off guard. Then I embraced her back and give in to the kiss.\n\nShe started trying to use her tongue, and that's where I drew the line for that moment. I pushed her back as gently as I could.\n\n*\"Okay sweetie, I'm okay with it, but let's take this slowly.\"* She started pouting. She was trying to manipulate me. Her pouting face is my weakness and she knows it. I sit up in the bed and she slid to my lap.\n\n*\"I will take you on a date. A real date. Right now.\"* She stopped pouting and her face opened in a smile. *\"Let's go to the new mall that opened on the other city. I'll take us to lunch and a movie. Now go take a bath.\"*\n\nShe got up and walked out my room, I noticed she was swaying her hips more than usual. She knows that I share an opinion with sir Mix-a-Lot. As she walked out the door she turned her head back and gave me a little wink while biting her lips...\n\nWell, that's it for now. Although I fear I created a monster.\n\nI thank you guys for the help, specially t2discover.\n\nIf you want it, I'll share our date one of these days. But not now, the daily routine makes it hard to post daily.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",
