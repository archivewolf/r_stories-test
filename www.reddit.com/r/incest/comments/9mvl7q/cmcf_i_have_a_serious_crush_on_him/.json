He's the oldest cousin on our family, and kinda raised us (me, my older brother and his own little brother). We always lived fairly close and our parents (my mom and dad and my aunt, his mother) were always working, so when we where younger, he would look out for us, take us too and from school and babysit us till our parents got home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've always found him to be very attractive. His life consists of working, gym and binge watching series. We've always been very close, sharing (most of) our feelings to each other. I believe me and his brother are the only ones in our family to know he's actually bi. He never had a serious girlfriend. Even confessed to me that the girls he brought home where just so that our grandparents would get of his back about finding a woman for him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm kinda in the \"geeky girl\" look. I try to keep myself in shape by bike riding, but I'm nowhere near his resolve about working out and dieting. Putting in numbers, I believe myself to be a 6, while him would be at least a 9. I've been lurking reddit for some years nows, but just now I created the courage to post this here. I'm still a virgin, I'm saving myself for him, although I've had some experiences with boys.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe thing is I've always been in love with him. When we were younger I would say I wanted to marry him and be with him forever. By then, our family found it to be cute and joked about it. But the truth is I still feel the same. My fondest memory is from the summers, when he would come to our home to chill out in the pool in the weekends. Our parents were drinking in the backyard as my brother and other cousin (his little brother) would keep playing at the pool while I would stay with him, just drifting with him as he floated around the water.\n\nSometimes I wake up at night, wishing he would open the door, crawl into my bed and take me. I love going to his home, getting in his room and feeling his smell, remembering the few times when we slept in the same bed, cuddling. I've even, in more than one occasion, masturbated on his bed, while sniffing his bed sheets and pillows.\n\nWhen we were younger, he would put on some cartoons or movies to keep us entertained. I would always sit by his side and lean on his lap our shoulders. Our brothers abandoned this \"tradition\" as we grew up, but me and him kept seeing series and movies always we could. On the last couple years, between my college, his work and occasional girlfriends, our binge sessions have gotten fairly rare, but we still do it, although it has been some years since he let me sit or lean on his lap while we do it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHelp me r/incest, you're my only hope!\n\nI want him. To make him see me as a woman and claim me as his. To feel his body against mine... Hell, I WANT HIM TO FUCK ME!\n\nShould I try to go all out? Seduce him? Give hints about what I really feel about him? Be blunt? A serious talk?\n\nI believe he never saw me in that way, as, till now, the only thing I did was being \"clingier\" than usual on the last few weeks, but the only reaction I got from him was the same as always: He hugs me, sometimes kissing me in the cheek, and says I'm his favorite girl. (He says this since we were kids).\n\nBut more than anything, I fear that a failed attempt would make him get away from me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, any advice for a desperate girl?",
