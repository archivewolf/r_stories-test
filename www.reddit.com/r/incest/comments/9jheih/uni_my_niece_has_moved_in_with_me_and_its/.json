I live in London and my niece has gotten an offer to study at the Imperial College London which is one of the best universities in the world. She is the first person to go to the university in our family.\n\nWe are originally from a very poor Eastern European country. My sister\u2019s husband died a few years ago so my sister has been raising my niece alone. They live poorly compared to even our country\u2019s standards because my aunt only gets minimum wage which is approximately 350 euros per month and barely covers their living expenses.\n\nSo naturally my sister asked if her daughter could stay with me. I refused at first knowing that it would not be convenient for both of us to live together in a place which is meant for one person. Later on my sister had called me again asking for the same thing, she was crying, saying that she can\u2019t cover any expenses for her daughter. They don\u2019t have any collateral which could be used for taking a loan. So eventually I agreed and said that she could stay with me. So my niece flew to London and has been living with me for the past 1 month, and has just started her studies. \n\nI was right, it is quite inconvenient to live with her. I am renting a studio room together with the bathroom, and only the kitchen is shared between other tenants. I really can\u2019t afford to rent any more expensive place as I earn not much above the minimum wage working in factories, and in London that is not great. Also, I have to support my niece, buy extra food, give her some allowance for her personal purchases, etc. Not to mention some studying expenses will add up like books. Fortunately in the UK education system is good so she was able to get the loan for the studies in the UK itself. \n\nBesides not getting much privacy, not being able to bring any woman home, having to cook for two, saving no money, and so on, there are a few other things that really bother me. I have noticed I am getting sexually attracted to my niece. Honestly, it does not feel good. I feel disgusted of myself in a way. I sometimes even feel like I am some paedophile because I knew my niece since she was little. I know the attraction would probably happen living with any woman \u2013 young or older, related or not related. But still, the feeling I have seems wrong.\n\nAlso, it teases me to see her come out of the shower room wearing just her panties and a bra. And it\u2019s annoying having to hide my morning erection so she wouldn\u2019t freak out. And you know what\u2019s the most annoying thing? She probably still has hormones driving her crazy. I mean seriously. One time I woke up at night from her deep breathing because she was fingering herself. I could even hear the liquid sounds in her vagina when she was doing it. That is really fucking annoying because if I started doing anything I would just scare her probably. What if she tells about it to her mom? \n\nShe says she will find a job during the weekends and holidays but it still not going to be enough for her to live by herself, so it means she will have to live with me for the next 3 years. I can\u2019t take it so long\u2026 I was thinking to maybe ask my niece if she wanted to do something about it. I hope she wouldn\u2019t tell anyone as long as I approach the topic carefully. \n\nAm I being a selfish asshole thinking this way?",

You have not done anything and she is a young and attractive female. \n\n* **Item 1:** She is 100% at your mercy right now, and has zero power in this situation. DO NOT make a sexual request of her. \n* **Item 2:** She will be exploring &amp; experimenting. She will want to act like an adult and do adult things. \n* **Item 3:** The two of you need to have a few talks about your living conditions right away. \n\nIf I was in your position I would tell her that you want to have a talk and ask her when would be a good time. Let her know that it is going to cover a lot of stuff so may take a little while. \n\nLetting her set the time that works for her is a good first step. Start off by saying something to the effect of \"I am really happy &amp; proud for you and what you are doing. Being able to help you with that makes me happy. But some things have come up with you moving in that we need to talk about.\"\n\nMove in to address your concerns. I would go with something like \"I have been used to living alone and being able to have my privacy. Along with that being able to do what guys do in private. All that has changed, which I am ok with, but I still have habits and needs.  And I know you have needs as well. So we need to work something out that works for the both of us, without making each other uncomfortable.\"\n\nI would then say something like \"I want to be clear: I want you to feel safe and welcome here. I want you to think of this as your new home. And I am not asking you for anything strange. But we need to talk about duties/chores, what is ok to do when both of us are here and what is ok when alone.\"\n\nThis is where you can bring up how to split up house work. Get that out of the way and make sure she is doing at least half of the work. She needs to know that she is a part of the household and has responsibilities to it. \n\nNext up would be talking about dress code. If you want to see where things go in the future something like \"I've noticed you are very comfortable in just underware when I am around. I am ok with it, but have to admit it does affect me some. I only bring it up because if my having a natural reaction to a mostly undressed beautiful woman bothers you I would ask you to cover up more. I can't stop a normal biological reaction. \n\nRound things out with a request that she think about ways where you both can have \"alone nights\" if wanted/needed. Or maybe \"alone days\" where the person can have the home to themselves for a good chunk of time or be able to have a date over. Bring up  how money is tight and that \"getting a room\" somewhere else is not in the budget. State that you don't need anything right now, but would like to get something worked out in case either of you need it in the future. \n\nWork out the living conditions first. Make her feel at home and a part of the home. \n\nSTOP HIDING YOUR MORNING WOOD. It is a damn normal and natural part of being male and you acting weird or ashamed of it is only going to send her signals that you have creepy/weird reasons for being hard. \n\nIf she sees it and comments on it just at like it is no big deal and brush it off with \"every guy in the world wakes up this way, that's why there IS the term morning wood\" and go about your day.\n\nDON'T TALK BOUT SEX. DON'T BRING UP HER MASTURBATION. At least not **now**. Get things worked out and let her get comfortable. Then if she keeps doing it - and you want her to stop - you can playfully interrupt her with \"Thats really more of an alone time thing\". If you DON'T want her to stop go with \"Hey, *her name*, you kind of woke me up. You can keep going, I don't mind, but wanted to make sure you where aware.\" \n\nIf she keeps going or stops but then does it again when you are there it is a signal she is interested in more. Females do not knowingly masturbate in front of people, especially family, unless there is some kind of interest. If she gets mad embarrassed and never does it again when you are home that is also a signal. \n\nDon't expose yourself or masturbate or the like with her first. If she is interested and want to explore things with you she needs to make it clear and have it be her choice to push things. ",

It happens to any man , and just shows the penis is functioning normally. There is nothing to \"freak out\" about seeing a man with morning wood. You're busy, you don't have time to jerk it off or wait for it to go down.\n\n&gt; Also, it teases me to see her come out of the shower room wearing just her panties and a bra. \n\nLecture her about this. You're the one who's paying rent, your rules. Honestly she should feel grateful that you even let her stay with you. You can take a sexual angle in saying \"you're a man and its making you feel unconfortable seeing her like that\". Or non sexual saying \"Its not proper to come out of the shower like that. I don't care what you think, I'm the one paying rent.\"\n\n&gt;  One time I woke up at night from her deep breathing because she was fingering herself. I could even hear the liquid sounds in her vagina when she was doing it. That is really fucking annoying because if I started doing anything I would just scare her probably.\n\nOnce again your house , your rules. Tell her that you heard her fingering herself the night before. Tell her its noisy and annoying and if she wants to do it , then keep it quiet. \n\n&gt; What if she tells about it to her mom?\n\nI dunno about this. She practically begged you to let her niece stay. If anything you could just say no and let her sort out her own problems. Also if your sister has any brain cells you would understand the angle you are coming with. How its quite annoying to hear someone masturbating when you are trying to sleep. You aren't sexually harassing or flirting with her daughter.\n\n\nYou don't look like someone who's interested in pursuing a sexual relationship with her. So I suggest to ignore any advice here that involves trying to pursue one with her. Thats just horny r/incest users trying to morph your life into their fantasy.\n\n\n",

You&amp;#39;re busy, you don&amp;#39;t have time to jerk it off or wait for it to go down.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Also, it teases me to see her come out of the shower room wearing just her panties and a bra. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lecture her about this. You&amp;#39;re the one who&amp;#39;s paying rent, your rules. Honestly she should feel grateful that you even let her stay with you. You can take a sexual angle in saying &amp;quot;you&amp;#39;re a man and its making you feel unconfortable seeing her like that&amp;quot;. Or non sexual saying &amp;quot;Its not proper to come out of the shower like that. I don&amp;#39;t care what you think, I&amp;#39;m the one paying rent.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;One time I woke up at night from her deep breathing because she was fingering herself. I could even hear the liquid sounds in her vagina when she was doing it. That is really fucking annoying because if I started doing anything I would just scare her probably.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once again your house , your rules. Tell her that you heard her fingering herself the night before. Tell her its noisy and annoying and if she wants to do it , then keep it quiet. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;What if she tells about it to her mom?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I dunno about this. She practically begged you to let her niece stay. If anything you could just say no and let her sort out her own problems. Also if your sister has any brain cells you would understand the angle you are coming with. How its quite annoying to hear someone masturbating when you are trying to sleep. You aren&amp;#39;t sexually harassing or flirting with her daughter.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You don&amp;#39;t look like someone who&amp;#39;s interested in pursuing a sexual relationship with her. So I suggest to ignore any advice here that involves trying to pursue one with her. Thats just horny &lt;a href=\"/r/incest\"&gt;r/incest&lt;/a&gt; users trying to morph your life into their fantasy.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
