I brought my clothes along and dressed down there.\nI was just about to go out the door when Mom came out and asked if I was okay.\nWe talked quietly for half a minute and wished each other a good day.\nI kissed her on the cheek then on the lips.\nIt seemed rather furtive as we didn't want to be caught. \nI asked her what the two of them would do today.\n\nMom said, \"Probably argue a lot\". \n\nThen she smiled and said if it got too bad she would take my sister shopping.\n\nI chuckled and said, \"Fob her off with new clothes?\"\n\nShe laughed and said \"Well, it does work you know.\"\n\nI said, \"I'll have to remember that if we ever argue.\"\n\nShe crinkled up her nose.\nWe held hands as I moved toward the door and were at the very\u00a0 end of our finger tips when she finally released me like she didnt wish us to part ways.\n\nI knew I had to compartmentalize this and was glad to have my work to focus on. I went to McDonalds for coffee and breakfast. Then I went to work early and worked hard all day only thinking about Mom and Jenny fleetingly. Once I sent Mom a text and just wrote XO.\nAbout an hour later she sent me a smiley with big red kissy lips.\n\nWhen I got home after work Mom and Jenny were at the breakfast bar drinking tea. I walked up to Mom and breezily kissed her on the cheek. It was an innocent kind of kiss. One that any son might give to his mother.\u00a0 Then I bent down to likewise kiss my sister\u00a0 but she refused it. I thought, \"Okay. I will be patient.\"\n\nMom said, \"We were thinking about going out to dinner.\"\n\nI said, \"Sure. Where were you thinking about going?\"\n\nJenny piped up and said, \"Mom told me about that Vietnamese place to get some noodle soup - Pho or Fa or whatever it's called.\"\n\nI said, \"That sounds good. We like that place. I'll change clothes and be ready in a few.\"\n\nWe left then and on the way there my sister asked a lot of questions about my work. She seemed more calm than last night.\nAt the resturaunt we all were much more chipper and agreeable and just talked about sundry things. The 5 ton elephant was still in the room with us of course but we tried to have fun and mostly succeeded.\n\nWhen we got home we sat around and Jenny started back into the conversation from the night before.\nShe asked what Dad would think of Mom and I.\nI told her Dad couldn't say too much about us as he was having an affair when he died.\n\nJenny said \"NO!\" Very forcefully then turned to Mom and asked, \"That isn't true is it?\"\n\nMom told her it was and how she was thinking about a seperation when he died.\nJen couldn't believe it and asked, \"Really?\" a couple of times.\n\nThen she asked, \"How come you never told me about this?\"\n\nMom said, \"What was the point in telling everybody? He was gone shortly after I knew.\" \n\nThen she told her all the details and my sister was shocked and saddened by it all.\n\nShe said, \"What a fucked up family!\"\n\nMom said, \"Jennifer!!\"\n\nThen Jen said, \"Poor mom! First an unfaithful husband and now this.\"\n\nMom quickly replied, \"Tom is Not being unfaithful to me.\"\n\nJen said, \"I'm sorry. But both things are equally sad and sordid to me.\"\n\nI jumped in and said, \"What Mom and I have is Not sad Jen. We are not sad about it at all.\"\n\nShe just shrugged and said, \"Well...\"\n\nLater when we went to our rooms Jenny knocked and asked to come in.\nI let her in and she wanted to talk.\nI told her I would talk and would be frank and truthful but if she raised a fuss or was mean or judgemental she would have to leave.\n\nShe said \"Okay.\"\n\nShe asked me a lot of questions about other women I had been with and what we had done together. She wanted to know if I had gotten laid before so I cut to the chase and told her.\nI asked, \"Were you thinking I couldn't find a girl and settled on Mom?\"\n\nShe said, \"Yeah, I guess so. It's just so damned confusing. She's so much older than you. And she's your mother.\nWhat will you do when she's old and gray? Get rid of her for someone else?\"\n\nI told her I didn't know the future any more than she did. I said growing apart can happen to anyone. I said, \"Look what Dad was doing. Maybe she'll leave me.\"\n\nThen she kind of hedged around another question and wondered what kind of \"protection\" we were using.\nI said, \"Protection?\u00a0 You know Mom had her tubes tied after I was born.\"\n\nWhen I said that the light came on and she knew what I had implied.\nShe grimaced like she had just smelled a dirty diaper and said, \"That's so gross.\"\n\nI asked, \"Is it gross when your husband finishes in you?\"\n\n\"Well no. But he's my husband.\"\n\nI said, \"He's a man who's putting his life and love into you. What is the difference?\"\n\nShe said, \"It's Soo different. She's your Mother.\"\n\nI said, \"She's the woman I love. The woman I desire. The woman who knows me better than any woman on the planet could.\"\n\nShe just harumphed at that.\n\nI said, \"Mom said there is a difference between how people react emotionally versus how they react rationally to a thing.\"\n\nI went back to the examples of gay and interracial marriage. How they were condemned and illegal for a long time.\n\"Those were emotional reactions to \"different loving\". But we as a society are more rational now and though there are still many emotional hold-outs\u00a0 to those relationships the laws and minds of the nation are changing.\"\n\nShe asked, \"Do you think the laws against incest will change?\"\n\nI said, \"I'm sure they will.\u00a0 There is no rationality behind them. Only emotionalism.\"\n\nShe asked, \"What about damaged babies from it?\"\n\n\"Mom can't have babies.\"\n\n\"Well no but...\"\n\nI said,\"Mom is nearly 46. Women that age can usually still have babies and the likelyhood of a damaged child - Down's Syndrome or whatever -\u00a0 is at least as high for a woman her age as it is for a mother and son to have a baby.\nYet there are no laws preventing a woman from having a child at that age.\nWhy the difference in the laws?\"\n\nThen I asked, \"What of the thousands of mothers and sons who love each other and can't/won't have babies? Or the brothers and sisters who could practice birth control and maybe adopt. Or fathers and daughters? \nI can't see how we rationally can prevent them from loving each other.\"\n\nShe said, \"You've thought about this a lot havent you.\"\n\n\"Mom and I both have our eyes wide open. We went into this willingly.\"\n\n\"It's still all very creepy and sordid to me.\"\n\nI said, \"Well, for me having a gay lover would be creepy and sordid. But I don't have to do that kind of stuff do I?\"\n\nShe asked, \"Would you two get married if you could?\"\n\nI said, \"Of course we would. I asked her to marry me already.\"\n\n\"Jen said, \"Really?\" and gave me half a smile then asked, \"What did she say?\"\n\nI said, \"She started to cry and was very happy and said yes.\"\n\n\"Really?  Unbelievable. That's just too frickin weird.\"\u00a0 Then she laughed at the thought.\n\nI said, \"Ask her about it if you wish.\"\nThen I said, \"It's late Jen and I have to work tomorrow.\"\n\n\"Yeah, I know.\"\n\nI knew she was going to spend tomorrow and tomorrow night at her best childhood playmate's house who still lives in town.\nI said, \"You're going to spend tomorrow night at Julie's?\"\n\n\"Yes. It will be good to see her again.\"\n\nI said, \"You carry our lives in your hands now you know.\"\n\n\"Yes I know. Another burden to carry through life.\"\n\nI leaned toward her to kiss her cheek. She shrank back and frowned. Then she said, \"It's not like you have the plague I guess.\" and offered me her cheek and I kissed her.\n\nShe said, \"It's still creepy and sordid you know. I don't know if I'll ever get over being disgusted by this.\"\n\nI told her, \"It makes me sad to hear you say this but I do understand. We know it is probably shocking. We've talked a lot about how you will handle this. But  we're still the same mother and brother to you and care about you as before.\"\n\nShe briefly cocked her head to one side as if to shrug it all off and then she left my room.\n\n\n\n",

I don&amp;#39;t know if I&amp;#39;ll ever get over being disgusted by this.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I told her, &amp;quot;It makes me sad to hear you say this but I do understand. We know it is probably shocking. We&amp;#39;ve talked a lot about how you will handle this. But  we&amp;#39;re still the same mother and brother to you and care about you as before.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She briefly cocked her head to one side as if to shrug it all off and then she left my room.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
