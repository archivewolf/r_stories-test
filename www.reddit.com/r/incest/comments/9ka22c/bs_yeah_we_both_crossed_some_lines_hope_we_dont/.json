But just to re-cap quickly, everything's been fine up to this point, I'm pretty comfortable being a pet in front of my brother now and nothing too crazy or awkward had happened before a couple hours ago.\n\nBut anyway... I told my brother at some point that if me and him are alone and I'm being a pet, he should act like he's home alone, like not worry about me seeing him do anything, y'know. He made a \"joke\" about watching porn on the big TV in the living room, I just played it cool and said a pet wouldn't stop you... And forgot that conversation happened until I was wandering around as a pet and saw some lady on the TV doing things with her butt, and my naked brother watching with an erection...\n\nSo something else I need to confess is that I've been having some confusing feelings about how my brothers body looks now, like it's just really interesting, and even as a pet I couldn't stop myself from hopping on the couch and getting a close look... Or maybe I only did it because I was a pet. And he ignored me, like he's supposed to... And I got too close and started sniffing him all over... and he ejaculated on my face and head. No idea what a pet should do so I just froze and stared...Stayed frozen and when he finished he actually went to the bathroom, called me in and washed my face with a warm washcloth... It was nuts, I enjoyed that way too much...\n\nAnd now, aside from writing this post, I've stayed as a pet because I have no clue how to talk to him about what happened... Nor do I know what I'm gonna tell my boyfriend lol, I can't keep secrets. So... There's my confession. Someone come here and fix my problems for me, I need it, lol...",
