Because of the content of the advice that I got on here, I took much longer really thinking about what would be the right thing to do with regards to Ashley. I received a lot of feedback that really twisted me up inside and made me doubt how to move forward. There were points where I really thought about just calling everything off. I've never struggled with something so much before.\n\nThere were 2 main things that I kept coming back to that caused me to hesitate. Several comments/PMs pointed out that A) My sister could be idolizing some kind of false/perfect version of me in her head that just didn't exist, setting herself up for a dramatic 180 on her feelings and potentially a mental breakdown, and B) I was the only real male figure she had in her life once our father left, and that me pursuing a relationship with her (regardless of the fact that she initiated this whole thing) could do some kind of irreparable damage if we broke up because she might be too emotionally immature.\n\nI wrestled with that shit back and forth in my head for the better part of 2 weeks. Thankfully Ashley didn't bring up anything or act strangely the whole time. I finally decided she is a fucking adult for all intents and purposes and she deserved a chance to discuss it further. The idea of just denying her, before giving us the opportunity to talk more, just seemed too cold. So I texted her from work this past Sunday, asking if she'd be home that evening. Our mom was going to be at work again and we'd have the house to ourselves for the night.\n\nWhen I got home from work she greeted me at the door with a hug and a smile, but I could tell she was nervous. I was nervous too, since I was pretty sure that night was going to shape at least our immediate future, if not something much more long term. She had on little pink workout shorts and one of those tank tops with almost no sides, revealing her sports bra underneath. Her hair was up in a pony-tail and from what I could tell she had no makeup on. She apologized quietly, saying she had just gotten back from a run. I asked her if she wanted to go change or anything first, but she said she was fine.\n\nWe went in and sat in the living room on the couch and she turned off the TV. She turned and faced me, but looked down at the couch, obviously waiting for me to start, so I talked first to try and break the ice.\n\n\n**Me**: \"I'm unsure how to make this less awkward so I'm just going to start talking.\"\n\nWe both let out an anxious laugh before I continued.\n\n**Me**: \"I haven't had an easy time since our last talk... I've been wrestling with some stuff, most of which is about you and I, and the future...\"\n\n**Ashley**: *nodded* \"I get it...\"\n\n**Me**: \"You being ok is the most important part of all of this to me, especially with regards to us. All this stuff I want to talk to you about doesn't matter at the end of the day, because you're family and I love you no matter what. You're my sister, so I am extra concerned about hurting you. I need to ask you a few things, and tell you a few things, and I can already feel how hard it will be. I need to hear your thoughts, though. \"\n\n\nAshley just nodded again so I kept going.\n\n\n**Me**: \"... I am worried that you have an unrealistic view of me. I love that you were able to share your feelings last time. Once the shock was over it really did make me happy that you feel that way about me. But some of the stuff you said really made me think that you are putting me on a pedestal so high that I'll never be able to climb down from it. I'm just a regular asshole, Ash. You see me when I'm on my best behavior. But I get into fights with my girlfriends, we argue, I don't listen sometimes, I forget shit... you said you've dated a fair amount, but I need you to understand that I don't know if I'd be any different than anyone else with regards to the little stuff. I am scared you're blind to the fact that I'm just a guy, and that I can make regular guy mistakes. I can't promise you anything just because I'm your brother. I'm not perfect, because nobody is.\"\n\n\nShe bit her lower lip a little when I stopped talking to take a breath. All she said was, \"What else?\". She kept looking away while fidgeting a little bit with some pillows behind her.\n\n\n**Me**: \"...well...I'm also concerned because we grew up together. Dad left and it was just me and you for a while when Mom was trying to make ends meet and picking up all those new jobs... probably right around the time you wrote that stuff in your diary... I don't want to wind up hurting you and ruining your ability to find love because it didn't work out with someone who is close with you by default. I don't want to become some regret you can't shake later because you are blinded by your feelings. This is honestly much harder to talk to you about than I thought, so I might not be making much sense here. But I need to know... or rather need to understand how you'd feel if we started down this road and then we 'broke up'. Do you think we could just go back to how it was? I'm scared that even though you had feelings for me for so long that you aren't thinking about how badly this could end... even if nobody found out and everything else went perfectly, it still may not work out. I don't want to lose you as a sister, and I don't want to hurt your ability to find real love, if this turns out to not be what you thought it would be.\"\n\n\nI took a deep breath and enjoyed a split second of relief from getting all of that out in the open. It was easily the most awkward I've ever been, especially around her. Writing this out doesn't do justice to how nervous I was. Ashley didn't say or do anything at first when I stopped talking. After a few seconds, she lifted her hands up to her face and lightly slapped both of her cheeks a little, like she was trying to psych herself up. She let out a big sigh as she reached her hands behind her head, pulling the tie off of her ponytail. Her hair fell down around her, framing her face. She moved the stray hairs behind her ears with a sweep of her hands as she started talking.\n\n\n**Ashley**: \"You know that I have dated older guys for the most part, right?\"\n\n\nI literally had no idea. I shook my head no and she continued.\n\n\n**Ashley**: \"I'm telling you that because they wanted to treat me like I was stupid, too. Like I didn't know what I was talking about, or was too young for them to listen to what I had to say about something, or figured the reason I did or didn't want to do something was because I was younger than them and had less experience.\"\n\n**Me**: \"Ash, I don't think you are stupid...\"\n\n**Ashley**: \"But I told you already... I've loved you for as long as I can remember. But I've also never said anything to you because I knew it was fucked up for me to think about you that way. I knew it would be fucked up to try to... be with you. I felt broken. You have no idea how many times I've cried over the way I felt. And then I'd feel even worse, because they were feelings for you, and I love you! I've been thinking about this stuff for almost half of my life! When I was old enough to start dating, I had resolved myself to never tell you how I felt, because I assumed I was just broken. I tricked myself into thinking I knew what I was doing, because I was so sure I had gotten 'over you' at that point. I dismissed everything as childish when it came to my feelings for you. I wanted to forget how I felt for years...\"\n\n\nI could see her eyes getting glassy as she slowly opened up even more than last time.\n\n\n**Ashley**: \"...But...then I tried to have sex for the first time. And it was... such a disaster...\"\n\n\nShe was blushing so much that it almost looked like she had a sunburn. Her fists were balled up in her lap as she was talking, looking down at them the whole time.\n\n\n**Me**: \"What do you mean a disaster?\"\n\n**Ashley**: \"...The second he had his hands on me, I felt guilty. It made my heart hurt. I wanted it to be you. I wanted to feel that way... because it was me and you. I started crying in the middle of him doing stuff to me... he thought he hurt me at first, but he didn't do anything wrong... I just couldn't tell him why I was upset, which made him accuse me of being immature. We broke up right there, him standing there fully clothed as I was in the bed, naked, crying secretly over you. I felt like trash... and so alone. On my way home from that train wreck I realized I couldn't let you go... that eventually I'd have to at least tell you how I felt. Of course, by the time I had gotten home, I'd convinced myself not to go through with telling you. But then it all happened again. Not the same way, but again, and again... I always thought of you... I was like a crazy person...\"\n\n**Me**: \"Ash... you're not crazy. But there are a lot of guys out there. You could find someone. We could both find someone amazing. Aren't you worried about missing that? Wouldn't that be easier? If I focus on how hard it would be for us, and how many things could go wrong... it scares the shit out of me.\"\n\n\nShe looked up at me with an angry look.\n\n\n**Ashley**: \"...Easier? Easier than loving my brother?! Of course it would be! But do you think it's been easy having these feelings? You've been thinking about this for a WEEK. I've been thinking about this for YEARS. You're going over the same shit I've gone over in my head everyday for literally YEARS! I have already slowly been coming to terms with all that. The fantasy every girl has about meeting a guy and falling in love doesn't matter to me anymore, because I ALREADY LOVE YOU! I'm not looking for EASIER!\"\n\n**Me**: \"Ash, that makes me feel like you're sacrificing too much for-\"\n\n**Ashley**: \"But I'm not... That is why I did what I did. I needed you to understand! I forced myself...do you have any idea how hard all of this has been after all these years?\"\n\n\nHer voice was getting strained, a mix of sadness and frustration.\n\n\n**Me**: \"Ash...I don't want to upset you like this but I need to talk this out with you for my own sanity. You're right...it has only been a week for me, but-\"\n\n**Ashley**: \"I'm not upset with you. I am just... I am just mad at the UNIVERSE. I am mad that this ISN'T easy... but I don't care about easy. I'm ok with it all. I'm ok with giving up stuff if it means...\"\n\n\nShe trailed off. I was at a loss for words as she let out a shaky sigh and continued.\n\n\n**Ashley**: \"You telling me NOT to put you on a pedestal... you telling me how hard it will be, or how bad it will probably get if we break up, or how maybe there is something wrong with me because I feel this way, or that I'm not thinking clearly... I've heard it all before, from myself. I imagined how you'd react. I imagined the ugliest parts of this.  I've had the conversation with myself a million times. Really, even you just listening to how I feel without running in the other direction is already beyond how I thought it would go. It scared me too much to act on anything. But after I heard you and (ex-girlfriend) together that night I finally just didn't care anymore. She was such a... prude. I couldn't stand it. You'd never dated anyone like that before. I just had to try to... do something! I couldn't stand the thought of you getting serious with someone like that while not knowing how I felt. I couldn't keep going anymore without at least telling you...\"\n\n\n**Me**: \"Ash I don't think there is something wrong with you. I've literally never said that... I don't want to mess things up... or our family or our friends. Our lives! I mostly just don't want to hurt you because we rushed into something...\"\n\n\nThat set her off, and the tears started flowing. She looked right at me, with a look like I had said something terrible. She kept talking, and crying, trying to keep her composure the best she could.\n\n\n**Ashley**: \"But...you ARE hurting me. Please... can you just tell me if I'm allowed to love you? It's ok if I can't. It's ok if you can't feel like that about me... I always assumed that even if I worked up the courage to tell you that you'd... If you can't love me back... I'll be fine. But you assuming that I don't know what I want... telling me I could somehow be wrong about how I feel, or that I'm RUSHING into this... it reminds me of all the other guys... the feeling is too terrible. THIS ISN'T SOME WHIM! I can't just... STOP LOVING YOU!\n\n\nHer voice had slowly been creeping up in volume and desperation, until she was practically yelling the last part at me. My heart dropped into my stomach as she was frantically wiping tears away from her eyes. I looked down because I couldn't watch her crying over me again. The knot that was already in my stomach only got tighter, as I struggled with what she had just said. 'THIS ISN'T SOME WHIM!\" just echoed throughout my whole body. I was hurting her. She was crying because of my indecision. Because I'm a fucking idiot and couldn't make up my mind. I was scared. I was sitting there questioning her feelings that she has struggled with for so many years, how could that not upset her? Was it even fair for me to be comparing how difficult a single week of agonizing over this whole situation was to what she'd put herself through for so long? I knew by then that I DID have feelings for her, beyond family, but how could I compare mine to hers? Was it fair to her to move forward in a relationship given how new my feelings were compared to hers? The tug-of-war going on in my head was brutal...\n\n\n**Ashley**: \"...Didn't you feel it too?\"\n\n\nI was so lost in my own vortex of self pity at that point that I didn't realize she had calmed down and was looking at me.\n\n\n**Ashley**: \"The feeling when we hug... I could feel it when I kissed you last time... so warm... Isn't THAT enough? After last time, I knew I wasn't crazy. I knew I was right. I knew THIS was right!! Didn't you feel it too?!\"\n\n\nThe tension in her voice as she forced out her raw feelings at me cut into me like a knife. She wasn't holding anything back, yelling them at me, red-faced and upset, but without hesitation. Looking back on it now, it was one of the most beautiful things I've ever had any girl say to me. I couldn't temper my reaction to such a deep question.\n\n\n**Me**: \"OF COURSE I felt it! How could I not!? That's what scares me the most! WHAT THE FUCK am I supposed to do with that?!?\"\n\n**Ashley**: \"KISS ME YOU IDIOT!! And don't stop unless I tell you to!!!\"\n\n\nIf she was any girl other than my sister I wouldn't have had any control in that situation. But traces of my indecision were still preventing me from completely letting go. I reached my hand out towards her face, running my fingers through her hair slightly before she nudged herself against it like a cat and looked at me. I leaned in towards her and kissed her softly on the lips a few times. My heart was beating just as hard as the last time we'd kissed, and I momentarily forgot every shred of experience I had with regards to kissing and girls in general. As if sensing my hesitation, she reached out and grabbing a handful of my shirt, tugging it close to her as she started falling backwards. I let her pull me along with her, down to the couch, leaving me on all fours over her.\n\nThe look she was giving me from below was still alien to me. It was my first time seeing an expression like that from her. The passion in her eyes was so deep I had to look away, down at the floor beside the couch. It wasn't the time to be indecisive, but I was also completely unable to stop the butterflies I had swarming in my stomach. She tugged at me, still having a handful of my shirt, bringing my attention back. She lifted herself up enough to kiss me again, our tongues picking up from where we had left off the last time. It wasn't easy to admit to myself, but she felt so good. I pulled her into me more as we kept kissing. She smelled amazing, even after supposedly taking a run. 'Her hair smells so nostalgic...\" I thought to myself. After a moment, something unexpected popped in my head.\n\nI swear I felt my brain tingle for a second as I recovered a memory I had most likely obliterated with a night out partying at school. I remembered sometime in the last year Ashley tried a new shampoo and had me smell her hair, asking if I liked it. I said something smart ass at first, but eventually told her that I liked the \"old smell better\". She said she'd change back, since I didn't like it. Here it was months later, and she obviously did just that. Is that what she meant when she had said last time that she'd been dropping little hints about her feelings? How many other times has she done something like that because of my opinion or commentary? It was like one of those montage scenes from a movie, with numbers and equations flying overhead, as I connected the dots in my mind with several other times she'd done something similar.\n\nThat's when it happened. I felt a wall I had up with her just melt away. \"I fucking LOVE this girl\", is all I could think. Through all of her doubt and turmoil she has gone through because she had feelings for me, she was still thinking about me with something as simple as her shampoo, hoping I'd pick up on why she even gave a shit about MY opinion to begin with! It's so ridiculous and cute, but also so immeasurably thoughtful, that I could barely contain myself.\n\nI stopped kissing her and let her fall slowly back down to the couch. I have no idea what kind of face I had on me during the few seconds it took for all that stuff above to shoot across my brain, but my sister was giving me a puzzled look. I opened my mouth and at first nothing came out. \"...Ash...I love you\" is all I could barely muster. I couldn't begin to describe to her what I was feeling right then, so that's all she got from me. She smiled widely and said, \"I know...but I didn't say stop...\"\n\nWhat a spark that caused in me. I laughed loudly and from there on out I was firing on all cylinders. I was on a mission to stop my hesitation and make her feel good. I thought about all those assholes she'd been with who she couldn't feel comfortable with, who treated her badly when she'd want to stop. Every fiber of my being was working towards the goal of washing those events from her memory and helping her understand how I really felt.\n\nI leaned down and kissed her, trailing up to her ear so I could bite her earlobe a little bit. I felt her jump as she let out a little \"Eep!\". The cuteness of her reaction can't be overstated. Her hands ran up my back and stopped at my shoulders, pulling me down against her more. I made my way down around her collarbone and across to the other side, and gave her other ear a little nibble as well. She squeaked again, before letting out a shaky half sigh/half laugh. I felt her hands move down quickly and start tugging at the bottom of my shirt. But this wasn't her show, it was mine. I pushed myself up a little bit and grabbed her arms. Bringing them back behind her head and crossing them so I could grab both her wrists with one hand. I bent down and kissed her again, feeling her playfully struggle to get her hands free. She smiled mid kiss and I could hear little moans escape from under her breath like she was unsure how to handle it. With my free hand I pulled her shirt up just slightly and ran my finger along her stomach, just above the top of her shorts. Her head shot back, letting me kiss up her neck to her chin as my hand made a u-turn and moved north, stopping to grab at her chest through her sports bra. After a minute, I let her hands go. They immediately shot back down to the bottom of my shirt, frantically pulling up at it as she kissed me wildly.\n\nLuckily part of my brain was still working, and it reminded me that we were still on the couch in the living room. I stopped kissing her and sat back a little on my heels before getting up off the couch. Before she could say anything I said, \"Let's go!\" and I bent over and lifted her off the couch in my arms. I carried her out of the living room, down toward our bedrooms. The biggest smile crept across her face, as we walked towards my room, while she stared into my eyes the whole way. As we got in front of the door to my bedroom she said, \"No, my room!\" so I walked down the hall to her door. She was kicking her legs a little bit and giggling as we walked. She seemed so happy, and it just made me even more focused. Nudging the door with my foot we walked in and I took a second to turn around and kick it closed. I walked over to her bed on the far side of the room and plopped her down on it so she was sitting on the edge. She immediately stood up and started pulling my shirt off. As soon as she had thrown it on the ground next to us, I pulled her shirt off as well before pushing her back down on the bed. Before I did anything else, she grabbed at her sports bra and ripped it off. She noticed me stop and stare, so she playfully tried to hide her chest from me as she sat up a little. I smiled and said, \"You're beautiful\" as I leaned down and kissed up her stomach, sliding my hand up to grab at her chest.\n\nI took my time kissing and licking my way up from her stomach. As soon as I licked a nipple, though, she let out a sharp gasp and a hand flew onto the top of my head. 'Nice reaction' I thought to myself. I kept playing with her nipples and it was driving her crazy. Her other hand came up and was dragging fingernails across my back before long (not hard, but enough to leave no doubt that I was making her feel good, which was a big turn on). I kissed her again as she brought her hands back up to my head, running them through my hair and grabbing on a little as we made out. I started kissing back down her neck, to her chest and stomach, before stopping below her belly button and getting onto my knees beside the bed. I looked back up at her as I kissed the inside of her thighs, moving slowly in towards her, setting off waves of goosebumps. I stopped as I reached the bottom of her shorts. She was laying back so I reached up and used my index finger to hook onto the top of her shorts on the other side. I gave her shorts a little tug and she lifted her head. I said, \"You ok?\". I didn't mean to set her off at all, but her face scrunched up and her eyes started getting teary almost immediately. I got up and bent down over her as she said, \"Better than ok. Don't stop!\" I kissed her quickly and said, \"Ok... prepare yourself!\" She laughed a little and said, \"Ok!\" with a big smile on her face. (In the moment it was fine, but now after the fact it makes me feel stupid as all hell that I said that lol)\n\nI stood up as she lifted her legs and put her feet on my stomach. I reached down and pulled everything off her in one fell swoop, dropping it to the floor next to us. It then hit me that that was going to be the first time I had really even seen her lower half naked...ever. I had never really gotten a look even when she came in the shower with me that day. I dropped back down on my knees and moved in close to her, getting her feet on top of my shoulders as I grabbed her by the hips and dragged her closer to the edge of the bed. She was immaculate and smooth all over, except for a tiny little landing-strip above. I felt her stir a little and she lifted her head up and said, \"...do I look...ok?\", obviously embarrassed. She looked perfect to me. Her pussy was sorta small and compact, but also kinda... chubby? It was cute, for lack of a better descriptor. I simply said to her, \"Ash, you look incredible\" as I leaned in.\n\nHer hands were immediately in my hair as I started kissing and licking circles all over. As I finally started really eating her out, her whole lower half arched up as she gave me a nice, loud, \"Holy shit!\". The first real moans I heard escape her mouth were the most satisfying thing I've ever heard from any girl. It's not like I'd really been doing anything differently up until that point with Ashley that I hadn't ever done with any new girl I'd ever been with. But taking my time and savoring every reaction was not something I ever bothered with before. I was making her feel good, and it was intoxicating for me. The more I ate her out, the louder she got, and the more I wanted to keep going. My name slipped out a few times between her moans, and every time it did I felt the butterflies that had taken up residence in my stomach do a few barrel rolls. Foreplay with every other one of my previous girlfriends was a CHORE. It was something I felt I HAD to do, it was part of the \"routine\" after a while. But with my sister... making her feel good was my only focus. I wasn't thinking beyond what I was doing, totally focusing on her. It was a new feeling, one I'm sure was because of how much I love her.\n\nI was keenly aware the entire time though that she had told me she was still a virgin, for all intents and purposes, regardless of the fact that she said she'd done \"pretty much everything else\". Partly out of curiosity, in between licks, I slowly started sliding a finger into her, expecting to hit a roadblock. After reaching my second knuckle, I was surprised to find no resistance, other than the fact that she felt tighter than any girl I'd ever felt before. I slid my finger out, not wanting to hurt her just in case. But she picked her head up a little and said, \"It's ok... that's good too!\" I slid my finger back in slowly, all the way this time. Nothing stopped me, although it barely felt able to accommodate my finger in there. Her reaction was immediate, as I felt her shimmy down a little more off the edge of the bed like she was trying to give me easier access. Her moans slowly turned into a mix of heavy breathing and squeaks as I continued licking and moving my finger in and out. One of her hands came off my head and started grabbing and ripping at the sheets, so I closed my eyes and upped the intensity to match her reactions. Before long she was pushing my face into her with both hands on the top of my head as she came. She came so quietly too, especially compared to other girls I've been with and even her own reactions leading up to it. She let out a quick initial \"Oh my...!\" which was followed up by waves of goosebumps and convulsions. Her hands actually swung up and smacked her stomach/chest a few times because of it. It was so fucking cute. I waited a few seconds and started poking around again with my tongue, but I heard her say, \"Wait...gimme a second...\" between short, quick breaths.\n\nI got up and slid onto the bed next to her, laying on my side so I could watch her. I started running my hand from above her chest all the way down along her legs and then back up a few times as her convulsions slowly subsided. I took that time to really take her all in and just admire how sexy she was. She finally opened her eyes, which had been closed tightly until then, and blinked a few times. I smiled down at her and said, \"You ok? Feel good?\" She smiled and closed her eyes again, letting out a long sigh. With her eyes still closed she said, \"I'm not exaggerating when I say... that was easily the best anyone has ever made me feel doing that\". I leaned in and kissed her as I continued running my hand all over. Before long, she grabbed both of my shoulders and pushed me as she struggled a little to get more vertical. She kept pushing me back as she swung a leg over me and got on top, pinning me to the bed.\n\nWhile everything in me wanted to keep going, and just ride that train all the way to wherever she wanted to take me, I made the decision to not go much farther than what we'd done already that day. I was thrilled she was being so forward, and the sight of her looking down at me from that position started chipping away at my willpower. But I didn't want to rush things, which was not something I normally give a shit about. I wanted her first time, both with me and ever, to be a little more special than a quickie in her bedroom. 'At the very least I owe her that much', I thought to myself as I fought against the raging hard-on I had going.\n\nAs all that passed through my head, she had already worked her butt down to below my waist and was fidgeting with my belt. I grabbed her hands and pulled her up towards me, forcing her into a kiss. I could feel her hips moving a bit, grinding into me. She was making things very difficult. Maybe I should have just done what she wanted. But at the end of the day she is still my sister, and just wanting to get a piece of ass wasn't the first thing on my mind, surprisingly. I forced myself to slow everything down.\n\nI pushed her up into a sitting position and sat up, getting her legs stretched out behind me so she was in my lap facing me.\n\n\n**Me**: \"Hey... Ash, that's enough for today.\"\n\n**Ashley**: \"What?! But... you did all the work... that's not fair!\"\n\n**Me**: \"I know, and trust me... I want all of you right now. It'd be very easy for me to keep going and let you do what you want... but let's stop for now...\"\n\n**Ashley**: \"Oooooooohhh... fine.\"\n\n\nShe took a minute to run her hands over my stomach and chest a few times, biting her lip a little as she did. Eventually she brought both hands up around my neck and cupped my face as she leaned down and kissed me. She let out a frustrated noise and said, \"You know... you're a really good kisser.\"\n\n\n**Me**: \"Is that all I'm really good at?\", with eyebrows raised for effect.\n\n**Ashley**: \"No... it was all good. Everything felt so good... especially down there... (her hands slid down her stomach to just below her waistline and pressed in a little as she was talking)... But the way you were with me... everything was... oh my god, I'm getting excited just thinking about it.\"\n\n\nI grabbed her by the waist before running my hands up and down her sides and across her chest too. She giggled as I grabbed what is barely a handful of her chest for a second on the way by.\n\n\n**Me**: \"You feel so good Ash... and you look even better. I definitely lost myself in you for a while. I was having too much fun making you squeak.\"\n\n**Ashley**: \"Oh my god, squeak? Is THAT what I was doing?\"\n\n**Me**: \"Uh, yeah. How else would you describe the sounds you were making?\"\n\n**Ashley**: \"That is definitely something a few guys have made fun of me for... before I dumped their asses!\"\n\n\nWe both laughed. I could tell she was happy. She didn't stop smiling and it was having the same effect on me. I had to tell her how I really felt and ask her what she wanted to do. I could think of no better time or place to do that than while she was sitting there, smiling down from her perch on top of me.\n\n\n**Me**: \"Ash, I love you.\"\n\n**Ashley**: \"I know!\"\n\n**Me**: \"No, I mean... I feel like an idiot for fighting my feelings. It took me a while to come to terms with you confessing everything the way you did to me. I had to allow myself to give in to the feelings you sparked inside of me. It gives me a knot in my stomach thinking about how long you've dealt with this. I'm sorry I never noticed that you were trying to clue me in for so long. But I know now. The thought of not even trying to make this work with you just seems... I feel like that would be a huge mistake. The feeling you give me scared the shit out of me at first, but I want more. More than might be possible. But I also know that I want to try to do this right. I don't want to just... have sex with you and then pretend everything else is the same. I said I love you, but I am not just saying it because you're my sister anymore. I want to explore all of this with you. We just have to do it smart, and make sure...\"\n\n\nShe was still smiling, but she started tearing up. She brought her hand up to my face and put the tips of her fingers over my mouth, so I stopped talking. She wiped her eyes and took a deep breath, shaking both hands in a fan-like motion towards herself to move some air around.\n\n\n**Ashley**: \"I'm sorry... I'm sorry... I just need a second...\"\n\n**Me**: \"Seeing you cry is really tough, you know. It hurts extra to see you cry and know it's because of me.\"\n\n**Ashley**: \"I'm not upset right now though. I'm so happy. I just can't even believe... you're saying this to me. I never thought...\"\n\n\nShe started crying again. It was really becoming a theme with her. If anyone reading this wants to start a drinking game anytime she cries for future posts, I can basically guarantee you getting drunk by the end. All joking aside though, the feeling of knowing she was that happy was invigorating. I am unsure if I've ever had a girl cry tears of joy like that in front of me until my sister.\n\nI put my arms around her and pulled her close, and she did the same. I kept talking as we hugged.\n\n\n**Me**: \"Ash, I want to do this right. There is no shortage of scary stories and comments online about how this can go really badly if we aren't careful. And we really need to figure out what exactly we are going to do with... all of this we are trying to start here. I wasn't going to do anything like what we did just now, not until after we figured all of this out first. But after we talked before, and you told me to kiss you, I just let myself go a little because I finally realized I wanted this too and just didn't care anymore about the stuff that was holding me back. You broke me all the way down.\"\n\n\nShe just squeezed me tighter, saying my name slowly before, \"I love you so much... I'll do whatever, I just want you. Let's try.\"\n\nWe stayed like that for a while. Eventually it became uncomfortable to stay sitting like that and we both got up and got dressed. She sat down on the edge of the bed and put her hair back up in a pony tail. I sat down in a chair and wheeled it over from her desk to the edge of her bed, similar to how we had been the first night I confronted her. How do you really even start a conversation about a secret relationship with your sibling? Apparently my sister already knew.\n\n\n**Ashley**: \"So... I think I have an idea.\"\n\n**Me**: \"Ok... I'm all ears because there is a lot that I am not sure of with regards to trying to work out the logistics here...\"\n\n**Ashley**: \"I think we should just be 'dating'. That means no sleeping around, no going on other dates, etc. Like a... normal relationship. Ugh...I mean... same rules as if we were just...\" She giggled a little, unsure of how to even classify what the fuck we were doing.\n\n**Me**: \"I get it. I know what you mean. That's obvious for me, because even if you were ok with it I wouldn't want to keep sleeping around if I'm 'with' you. I'm not like that.\"\n\n**Ashley**: \"Ok... well good!\"\n\n**Me**: \"Any ideas on all the other stuff?\n\n\nShe shook her head \"no\".\n\n\n**Me**: \"Well... I am worried mostly about my friends. They'd know something was up if I didn't say something to them after breaking up with (ex-girlfriend). If they ask sometime soon, I'll just tell them I am \"staying single\" for a while because the breakup was \"rough\". But once that wears off, I think I'd like to try having you come and hang out with me and them once in a while. Like... I could tell them how we got drunk or something and you told me that you wanted to come hang out with me, and see what it's like to party at a real university... just get them used to you being around so I don't have to completely exclude you from that part of my life.\u201d\n\n\n**Ashley**: \"That might be nice... but I feel like we may want to save that for... much later. I really want to try going out, just the two of us, first. I need to make sure I'm not going to screw something up... like try to kiss you or something in public.\"\n\n\nShe is 4 years younger than me, but I am constantly amazed at how much more mature she is than me sometimes.\n\n \n**Me**: \"Listen... I am going to be right there with you hoping I don't fuck anything up either. This is alllll new to me. But we can't treat this like a game. This is serious.\"\n\n**Ashley**: \"What... about when we're here?\"\n\n**Me**: \"I would say as long as Mom isn't home then we are free to do whatever. But don't forget I am going to be moving out. That's probably only a few months away.\"\n\n\nShe got a look on her face like she had forgotten something important.\n\n\n**Ashley**: \"Oh... I forgot about that... oh man...\"\n\n**Me**: \"Hey, if anything it might make things easier. I promise to get an apartment with a door that locks on it!\" I laughed, which prompted her to laugh as well. But I could tell that she was still concerned.\n\n**Ashley**: \"What if... What if we get more serious?\"\n\n**Me**: \"Then we'll cross that bridge when we come to it. I can't pretend to have all of the answers here, Ash. If anything, you've thought about this much longer than I have. But in talking with people and reading up on stuff, there are plenty of situations and people out there that work this sorta thing work. There are just some lines you can't cross, ever. Worst case, if we're worried, we could move or something. But I don't want to get too ahead of ourselves here. Let's see how it goes. When I figure out a date that I am going to move out, and then figure out where I am going to go, I promise we will talk again and figure it out. Until then... we should just see what happens, I think.\"\n\n**Ashley**: \"Ok... I'm good with that. So... no public displays of affection, no doing stuff when Mom is home, and no hanging out with each other's friends and stuff until we are more... normal.\" She giggled again at the \"normal\" thing.\n\n\nAfter that we hugged and kissed for a while, and then made our way back out to the couch to watch some TV. Rest of the night was pretty normal.\n\nNothing really big has happened since then. We have fooled around a couple more times when time allowed for it, but we haven't gone much further. We also went out to a movie, just the two of us. Things were fine and really we were mostly just \"brother and sister\" that whole time, no real awkwardness at all. But mostly I've just been enjoying watching her be so happy and open with me. I've also started retaliating against the ass slaps/kisses she has always done. I grab her and kiss her randomly all the time now, and not just little pecks on the cheek like she gave me for all those years. She's told me that she always wished they were real kisses, so I've made that a reality for her and she has told me how happy it makes her on several occasions already.\n\nTo tell the truth I am still scared about a lot of this stuff, especially someone finding out, but I am also really happy. Easily the happiest I've been with a girl ever. And she has been walking on sunshine since our last talk. She's been amazing, and we are really good together from what I can tell so far. It's still early but I am optimistic.\n\nSince we are taking things slowly, I don't think I'll have anything steamy or any grand revelations for a while. I promise I'll come back and give an update eventually once we have been together for a while or if anything happens and I need more advice. In closing, I'll just ask that everyone reading this enjoy their lives and whoever is around them, no matter who they are.\n\n**Edit:** Typos and Grammar",

Because of the content of the advice that I got on here, I took much longer really thinking about what would be the right thing to do with regards to Ashley. I received a lot of feedback that really twisted me up inside and made me doubt how to move forward. There were points where I really thought about just calling everything off. I&amp;#39;ve never struggled with something so much before.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There were 2 main things that I kept coming back to that caused me to hesitate. Several comments/PMs pointed out that A) My sister could be idolizing some kind of false/perfect version of me in her head that just didn&amp;#39;t exist, setting herself up for a dramatic 180 on her feelings and potentially a mental breakdown, and B) I was the only real male figure she had in her life once our father left, and that me pursuing a relationship with her (regardless of the fact that she initiated this whole thing) could do some kind of irreparable damage if we broke up because she might be too emotionally immature.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wrestled with that shit back and forth in my head for the better part of 2 weeks. Thankfully Ashley didn&amp;#39;t bring up anything or act strangely the whole time. I finally decided she is a fucking adult for all intents and purposes and she deserved a chance to discuss it further. The idea of just denying her, before giving us the opportunity to talk more, just seemed too cold. So I texted her from work this past Sunday, asking if she&amp;#39;d be home that evening. Our mom was going to be at work again and we&amp;#39;d have the house to ourselves for the night.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I got home from work she greeted me at the door with a hug and a smile, but I could tell she was nervous. I was nervous too, since I was pretty sure that night was going to shape at least our immediate future, if not something much more long term. She had on little pink workout shorts and one of those tank tops with almost no sides, revealing her sports bra underneath. Her hair was up in a pony-tail and from what I could tell she had no makeup on. She apologized quietly, saying she had just gotten back from a run. I asked her if she wanted to go change or anything first, but she said she was fine.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We went in and sat in the living room on the couch and she turned off the TV. She turned and faced me, but looked down at the couch, obviously waiting for me to start, so I talked first to try and break the ice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me&lt;/strong&gt;: &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m unsure how to make this less awkward so I&amp;#39;m just going to start talking.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We both let out an anxious laugh before I continued.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me&lt;/strong&gt;: &amp;quot;I haven&amp;#39;t had an easy time since our last talk... I&amp;#39;ve been wrestling with some stuff, most of which is about you and I, and the future...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ashley&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;nodded&lt;/em&gt; &amp;quot;I get it...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me&lt;/strong&gt;: &amp;quot;You being ok is the most important part of all of this to me, especially with regards to us. All this stuff I want to talk to you about doesn&amp;#39;t matter at the end of the day, because you&amp;#39;re family and I love you no matter what. You&amp;#39;re my sister, so I am extra concerned about hurting you. I need to ask you a few things, and tell you a few things, and I can already feel how hard it will be. I need to hear your thoughts, though. &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ashley just nodded again so I kept going.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me&lt;/strong&gt;: &amp;quot;... I am worried that you have an unrealistic view of me. I love that you were able to share your feelings last time. Once the shock was over it really did make me happy that you feel that way about me. But some of the stuff you said really made me think that you are putting me on a pedestal so high that I&amp;#39;ll never be able to climb down from it. I&amp;#39;m just a regular asshole, Ash. You see me when I&amp;#39;m on my best behavior. But I get into fights with my girlfriends, we argue, I don&amp;#39;t listen sometimes, I forget shit... you said you&amp;#39;ve dated a fair amount, but I need you to understand that I don&amp;#39;t know if I&amp;#39;d be any different than anyone else with regards to the little stuff. I am scared you&amp;#39;re blind to the fact that I&amp;#39;m just a guy, and that I can make regular guy mistakes. I can&amp;#39;t promise you anything just because I&amp;#39;m your brother. I&amp;#39;m not perfect, because nobody is.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She bit her lower lip a little when I stopped talking to take a breath. All she said was, &amp;quot;What else?&amp;quot;. She kept looking away while fidgeting a little bit with some pillows behind her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me&lt;/strong&gt;: &amp;quot;...well...I&amp;#39;m also concerned because we grew up together. Dad left and it was just me and you for a while when Mom was trying to make ends meet and picking up all those new jobs... probably right around the time you wrote that stuff in your diary... I don&amp;#39;t want to wind up hurting you and ruining your ability to find love because it didn&amp;#39;t work out with someone who is close with you by default. I don&amp;#39;t want to become some regret you can&amp;#39;t shake later because you are blinded by your feelings. This is honestly much harder to talk to you about than I thought, so I might not be making much sense here. But I need to know... or rather need to understand how you&amp;#39;d feel if we started down this road and then we &amp;#39;broke up&amp;#39;. Do you think we could just go back to how it was? I&amp;#39;m scared that even though you had feelings for me for so long that you aren&amp;#39;t thinking about how badly this could end... even if nobody found out and everything else went perfectly, it still may not work out. I don&amp;#39;t want to lose you as a sister, and I don&amp;#39;t want to hurt your ability to find real love, if this turns out to not be what you thought it would be.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I took a deep breath and enjoyed a split second of relief from getting all of that out in the open. It was easily the most awkward I&amp;#39;ve ever been, especially around her. Writing this out doesn&amp;#39;t do justice to how nervous I was. Ashley didn&amp;#39;t say or do anything at first when I stopped talking. After a few seconds, she lifted her hands up to her face and lightly slapped both of her cheeks a little, like she was trying to psych herself up. She let out a big sigh as she reached her hands behind her head, pulling the tie off of her ponytail. Her hair fell down around her, framing her face. She moved the stray hairs behind her ears with a sweep of her hands as she started talking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ashley&lt;/strong&gt;: &amp;quot;You know that I have dated older guys for the most part, right?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I literally had no idea. I shook my head no and she continued.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ashley&lt;/strong&gt;: &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m telling you that because they wanted to treat me like I was stupid, too. Like I didn&amp;#39;t know what I was talking about, or was too young for them to listen to what I had to say about something, or figured the reason I did or didn&amp;#39;t want to do something was because I was younger than them and had less experience.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me&lt;/strong&gt;: &amp;quot;Ash, I don&amp;#39;t think you are stupid...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ashley&lt;/strong&gt;: &amp;quot;But I told you already... I&amp;#39;ve loved you for as long as I can remember. But I&amp;#39;ve also never said anything to you because I knew it was fucked up for me to think about you that way. I knew it would be fucked up to try to... be with you. I felt broken. You have no idea how many times I&amp;#39;ve cried over the way I felt. And then I&amp;#39;d feel even worse, because they were feelings for you, and I love you! I&amp;#39;ve been thinking about this stuff for almost half of my life! When I was old enough to start dating, I had resolved myself to never tell you how I felt, because I assumed I was just broken. I tricked myself into thinking I knew what I was doing, because I was so sure I had gotten &amp;#39;over you&amp;#39; at that point. I dismissed everything as childish when it came to my feelings for you. I wanted to forget how I felt for years...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I could see her eyes getting glassy as she slowly opened up even more than last time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ashley&lt;/strong&gt;: &amp;quot;...But...then I tried to have sex for the first time. And it was... such a disaster...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She was blushing so much that it almost looked like she had a sunburn. Her fists were balled up in her lap as she was talking, looking down at them the whole time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me&lt;/strong&gt;: &amp;quot;What do you mean a disaster?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ashley&lt;/strong&gt;: &amp;quot;...The second he had his hands on me, I felt guilty. It made my heart hurt. I wanted it to be you. I wanted to feel that way... because it was me and you. I started crying in the middle of him doing stuff to me... he thought he hurt me at first, but he didn&amp;#39;t do anything wrong... I just couldn&amp;#39;t tell him why I was upset, which made him accuse me of being immature. We broke up right there, him standing there fully clothed as I was in the bed, naked, crying secretly over you. I felt like trash... and so alone. On my way home from that train wreck I realized I couldn&amp;#39;t let you go... that eventually I&amp;#39;d have to at least tell you how I felt. Of course, by the time I had gotten home, I&amp;#39;d convinced myself not to go through with telling you. But then it all happened again. Not the same way, but again, and again... I always thought of you... I was like a crazy person...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me&lt;/strong&gt;: &amp;quot;Ash... you&amp;#39;re not crazy. But there are a lot of guys out there. You could find someone. We could both find someone amazing. Aren&amp;#39;t you worried about missing that? Wouldn&amp;#39;t that be easier? If I focus on how hard it would be for us, and how many things could go wrong... it scares the shit out of me.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She looked up at me with an angry look.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ashley&lt;/strong&gt;: &amp;quot;...Easier? Easier than loving my brother?! Of course it would be! But do you think it&amp;#39;s been easy having these feelings? You&amp;#39;ve been thinking about this for a WEEK. I&amp;#39;ve been thinking about this for YEARS. You&amp;#39;re going over the same shit I&amp;#39;ve gone over in my head everyday for literally YEARS! I have already slowly been coming to terms with all that. The fantasy every girl has about meeting a guy and falling in love doesn&amp;#39;t matter to me anymore, because I ALREADY LOVE YOU! I&amp;#39;m not looking for EASIER!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me&lt;/strong&gt;: &amp;quot;Ash, that makes me feel like you&amp;#39;re sacrificing too much for-&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ashley&lt;/strong&gt;: &amp;quot;But I&amp;#39;m not... That is why I did what I did. I needed you to understand! I forced myself...do you have any idea how hard all of this has been after all these years?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Her voice was getting strained, a mix of sadness and frustration.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me&lt;/strong&gt;: &amp;quot;Ash...I don&amp;#39;t want to upset you like this but I need to talk this out with you for my own sanity. You&amp;#39;re right...it has only been a week for me, but-&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ashley&lt;/strong&gt;: &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m not upset with you. I am just... I am just mad at the UNIVERSE. I am mad that this ISN&amp;#39;T easy... but I don&amp;#39;t care about easy. I&amp;#39;m ok with it all. I&amp;#39;m ok with giving up stuff if it means...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She trailed off. I was at a loss for words as she let out a shaky sigh and continued.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ashley&lt;/strong&gt;: &amp;quot;You telling me NOT to put you on a pedestal... you telling me how hard it will be, or how bad it will probably get if we break up, or how maybe there is something wrong with me because I feel this way, or that I&amp;#39;m not thinking clearly... I&amp;#39;ve heard it all before, from myself. I imagined how you&amp;#39;d react. I imagined the ugliest parts of this.  I&amp;#39;ve had the conversation with myself a million times. Really, even you just listening to how I feel without running in the other direction is already beyond how I thought it would go. It scared me too much to act on anything. But after I heard you and (ex-girlfriend) together that night I finally just didn&amp;#39;t care anymore. She was such a... prude. I couldn&amp;#39;t stand it. You&amp;#39;d never dated anyone like that before. I just had to try to... do something! I couldn&amp;#39;t stand the thought of you getting serious with someone like that while not knowing how I felt. I couldn&amp;#39;t keep going anymore without at least telling you...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me&lt;/strong&gt;: &amp;quot;Ash I don&amp;#39;t think there is something wrong with you. I&amp;#39;ve literally never said that... I don&amp;#39;t want to mess things up... or our family or our friends. Our lives! I mostly just don&amp;#39;t want to hurt you because we rushed into something...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That set her off, and the tears started flowing. She looked right at me, with a look like I had said something terrible. She kept talking, and crying, trying to keep her composure the best she could.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ashley&lt;/strong&gt;: &amp;quot;But...you ARE hurting me. Please... can you just tell me if I&amp;#39;m allowed to love you? It&amp;#39;s ok if I can&amp;#39;t. It&amp;#39;s ok if you can&amp;#39;t feel like that about me... I always assumed that even if I worked up the courage to tell you that you&amp;#39;d... If you can&amp;#39;t love me back... I&amp;#39;ll be fine. But you assuming that I don&amp;#39;t know what I want... telling me I could somehow be wrong about how I feel, or that I&amp;#39;m RUSHING into this... it reminds me of all the other guys... the feeling is too terrible. THIS ISN&amp;#39;T SOME WHIM! I can&amp;#39;t just... STOP LOVING YOU!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Her voice had slowly been creeping up in volume and desperation, until she was practically yelling the last part at me. My heart dropped into my stomach as she was frantically wiping tears away from her eyes. I looked down because I couldn&amp;#39;t watch her crying over me again. The knot that was already in my stomach only got tighter, as I struggled with what she had just said. &amp;#39;THIS ISN&amp;#39;T SOME WHIM!&amp;quot; just echoed throughout my whole body. I was hurting her. She was crying because of my indecision. Because I&amp;#39;m a fucking idiot and couldn&amp;#39;t make up my mind. I was scared. I was sitting there questioning her feelings that she has struggled with for so many years, how could that not upset her? Was it even fair for me to be comparing how difficult a single week of agonizing over this whole situation was to what she&amp;#39;d put herself through for so long? I knew by then that I DID have feelings for her, beyond family, but how could I compare mine to hers? Was it fair to her to move forward in a relationship given how new my feelings were compared to hers? The tug-of-war going on in my head was brutal...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ashley&lt;/strong&gt;: &amp;quot;...Didn&amp;#39;t you feel it too?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was so lost in my own vortex of self pity at that point that I didn&amp;#39;t realize she had calmed down and was looking at me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ashley&lt;/strong&gt;: &amp;quot;The feeling when we hug... I could feel it when I kissed you last time... so warm... Isn&amp;#39;t THAT enough? After last time, I knew I wasn&amp;#39;t crazy. I knew I was right. I knew THIS was right!! Didn&amp;#39;t you feel it too?!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The tension in her voice as she forced out her raw feelings at me cut into me like a knife. She wasn&amp;#39;t holding anything back, yelling them at me, red-faced and upset, but without hesitation. Looking back on it now, it was one of the most beautiful things I&amp;#39;ve ever had any girl say to me. I couldn&amp;#39;t temper my reaction to such a deep question.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me&lt;/strong&gt;: &amp;quot;OF COURSE I felt it! How could I not!? That&amp;#39;s what scares me the most! WHAT THE FUCK am I supposed to do with that?!?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ashley&lt;/strong&gt;: &amp;quot;KISS ME YOU IDIOT!! And don&amp;#39;t stop unless I tell you to!!!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If she was any girl other than my sister I wouldn&amp;#39;t have had any control in that situation. But traces of my indecision were still preventing me from completely letting go. I reached my hand out towards her face, running my fingers through her hair slightly before she nudged herself against it like a cat and looked at me. I leaned in towards her and kissed her softly on the lips a few times. My heart was beating just as hard as the last time we&amp;#39;d kissed, and I momentarily forgot every shred of experience I had with regards to kissing and girls in general. As if sensing my hesitation, she reached out and grabbing a handful of my shirt, tugging it close to her as she started falling backwards. I let her pull me along with her, down to the couch, leaving me on all fours over her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The look she was giving me from below was still alien to me. It was my first time seeing an expression like that from her. The passion in her eyes was so deep I had to look away, down at the floor beside the couch. It wasn&amp;#39;t the time to be indecisive, but I was also completely unable to stop the butterflies I had swarming in my stomach. She tugged at me, still having a handful of my shirt, bringing my attention back. She lifted herself up enough to kiss me again, our tongues picking up from where we had left off the last time. It wasn&amp;#39;t easy to admit to myself, but she felt so good. I pulled her into me more as we kept kissing. She smelled amazing, even after supposedly taking a run. &amp;#39;Her hair smells so nostalgic...&amp;quot; I thought to myself. After a moment, something unexpected popped in my head.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I swear I felt my brain tingle for a second as I recovered a memory I had most likely obliterated with a night out partying at school. I remembered sometime in the last year Ashley tried a new shampoo and had me smell her hair, asking if I liked it. I said something smart ass at first, but eventually told her that I liked the &amp;quot;old smell better&amp;quot;. She said she&amp;#39;d change back, since I didn&amp;#39;t like it. Here it was months later, and she obviously did just that. Is that what she meant when she had said last time that she&amp;#39;d been dropping little hints about her feelings? How many other times has she done something like that because of my opinion or commentary? It was like one of those montage scenes from a movie, with numbers and equations flying overhead, as I connected the dots in my mind with several other times she&amp;#39;d done something similar.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s when it happened. I felt a wall I had up with her just melt away. &amp;quot;I fucking LOVE this girl&amp;quot;, is all I could think. Through all of her doubt and turmoil she has gone through because she had feelings for me, she was still thinking about me with something as simple as her shampoo, hoping I&amp;#39;d pick up on why she even gave a shit about MY opinion to begin with! It&amp;#39;s so ridiculous and cute, but also so immeasurably thoughtful, that I could barely contain myself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I stopped kissing her and let her fall slowly back down to the couch. I have no idea what kind of face I had on me during the few seconds it took for all that stuff above to shoot across my brain, but my sister was giving me a puzzled look. I opened my mouth and at first nothing came out. &amp;quot;...Ash...I love you&amp;quot; is all I could barely muster. I couldn&amp;#39;t begin to describe to her what I was feeling right then, so that&amp;#39;s all she got from me. She smiled widely and said, &amp;quot;I know...but I didn&amp;#39;t say stop...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What a spark that caused in me. I laughed loudly and from there on out I was firing on all cylinders. I was on a mission to stop my hesitation and make her feel good. I thought about all those assholes she&amp;#39;d been with who she couldn&amp;#39;t feel comfortable with, who treated her badly when she&amp;#39;d want to stop. Every fiber of my being was working towards the goal of washing those events from her memory and helping her understand how I really felt.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I leaned down and kissed her, trailing up to her ear so I could bite her earlobe a little bit. I felt her jump as she let out a little &amp;quot;Eep!&amp;quot;. The cuteness of her reaction can&amp;#39;t be overstated. Her hands ran up my back and stopped at my shoulders, pulling me down against her more. I made my way down around her collarbone and across to the other side, and gave her other ear a little nibble as well. She squeaked again, before letting out a shaky half sigh/half laugh. I felt her hands move down quickly and start tugging at the bottom of my shirt. But this wasn&amp;#39;t her show, it was mine. I pushed myself up a little bit and grabbed her arms. Bringing them back behind her head and crossing them so I could grab both her wrists with one hand. I bent down and kissed her again, feeling her playfully struggle to get her hands free. She smiled mid kiss and I could hear little moans escape from under her breath like she was unsure how to handle it. With my free hand I pulled her shirt up just slightly and ran my finger along her stomach, just above the top of her shorts. Her head shot back, letting me kiss up her neck to her chin as my hand made a u-turn and moved north, stopping to grab at her chest through her sports bra. After a minute, I let her hands go. They immediately shot back down to the bottom of my shirt, frantically pulling up at it as she kissed me wildly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Luckily part of my brain was still working, and it reminded me that we were still on the couch in the living room. I stopped kissing her and sat back a little on my heels before getting up off the couch. Before she could say anything I said, &amp;quot;Let&amp;#39;s go!&amp;quot; and I bent over and lifted her off the couch in my arms. I carried her out of the living room, down toward our bedrooms. The biggest smile crept across her face, as we walked towards my room, while she stared into my eyes the whole way. As we got in front of the door to my bedroom she said, &amp;quot;No, my room!&amp;quot; so I walked down the hall to her door. She was kicking her legs a little bit and giggling as we walked. She seemed so happy, and it just made me even more focused. Nudging the door with my foot we walked in and I took a second to turn around and kick it closed. I walked over to her bed on the far side of the room and plopped her down on it so she was sitting on the edge. She immediately stood up and started pulling my shirt off. As soon as she had thrown it on the ground next to us, I pulled her shirt off as well before pushing her back down on the bed. Before I did anything else, she grabbed at her sports bra and ripped it off. She noticed me stop and stare, so she playfully tried to hide her chest from me as she sat up a little. I smiled and said, &amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re beautiful&amp;quot; as I leaned down and kissed up her stomach, sliding my hand up to grab at her chest.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I took my time kissing and licking my way up from her stomach. As soon as I licked a nipple, though, she let out a sharp gasp and a hand flew onto the top of my head. &amp;#39;Nice reaction&amp;#39; I thought to myself. I kept playing with her nipples and it was driving her crazy. Her other hand came up and was dragging fingernails across my back before long (not hard, but enough to leave no doubt that I was making her feel good, which was a big turn on). I kissed her again as she brought her hands back up to my head, running them through my hair and grabbing on a little as we made out. I started kissing back down her neck, to her chest and stomach, before stopping below her belly button and getting onto my knees beside the bed. I looked back up at her as I kissed the inside of her thighs, moving slowly in towards her, setting off waves of goosebumps. I stopped as I reached the bottom of her shorts. She was laying back so I reached up and used my index finger to hook onto the top of her shorts on the other side. I gave her shorts a little tug and she lifted her head. I said, &amp;quot;You ok?&amp;quot;. I didn&amp;#39;t mean to set her off at all, but her face scrunched up and her eyes started getting teary almost immediately. I got up and bent down over her as she said, &amp;quot;Better than ok. Don&amp;#39;t stop!&amp;quot; I kissed her quickly and said, &amp;quot;Ok... prepare yourself!&amp;quot; She laughed a little and said, &amp;quot;Ok!&amp;quot; with a big smile on her face. (In the moment it was fine, but now after the fact it makes me feel stupid as all hell that I said that lol)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I stood up as she lifted her legs and put her feet on my stomach. I reached down and pulled everything off her in one fell swoop, dropping it to the floor next to us. It then hit me that that was going to be the first time I had really even seen her lower half naked...ever. I had never really gotten a look even when she came in the shower with me that day. I dropped back down on my knees and moved in close to her, getting her feet on top of my shoulders as I grabbed her by the hips and dragged her closer to the edge of the bed. She was immaculate and smooth all over, except for a tiny little landing-strip above. I felt her stir a little and she lifted her head up and said, &amp;quot;...do I look...ok?&amp;quot;, obviously embarrassed. She looked perfect to me. Her pussy was sorta small and compact, but also kinda... chubby? It was cute, for lack of a better descriptor. I simply said to her, &amp;quot;Ash, you look incredible&amp;quot; as I leaned in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Her hands were immediately in my hair as I started kissing and licking circles all over. As I finally started really eating her out, her whole lower half arched up as she gave me a nice, loud, &amp;quot;Holy shit!&amp;quot;. The first real moans I heard escape her mouth were the most satisfying thing I&amp;#39;ve ever heard from any girl. It&amp;#39;s not like I&amp;#39;d really been doing anything differently up until that point with Ashley that I hadn&amp;#39;t ever done with any new girl I&amp;#39;d ever been with. But taking my time and savoring every reaction was not something I ever bothered with before. I was making her feel good, and it was intoxicating for me. The more I ate her out, the louder she got, and the more I wanted to keep going. My name slipped out a few times between her moans, and every time it did I felt the butterflies that had taken up residence in my stomach do a few barrel rolls. Foreplay with every other one of my previous girlfriends was a CHORE. It was something I felt I HAD to do, it was part of the &amp;quot;routine&amp;quot; after a while. But with my sister... making her feel good was my only focus. I wasn&amp;#39;t thinking beyond what I was doing, totally focusing on her. It was a new feeling, one I&amp;#39;m sure was because of how much I love her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was keenly aware the entire time though that she had told me she was still a virgin, for all intents and purposes, regardless of the fact that she said she&amp;#39;d done &amp;quot;pretty much everything else&amp;quot;. Partly out of curiosity, in between licks, I slowly started sliding a finger into her, expecting to hit a roadblock. After reaching my second knuckle, I was surprised to find no resistance, other than the fact that she felt tighter than any girl I&amp;#39;d ever felt before. I slid my finger out, not wanting to hurt her just in case. But she picked her head up a little and said, &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s ok... that&amp;#39;s good too!&amp;quot; I slid my finger back in slowly, all the way this time. Nothing stopped me, although it barely felt able to accommodate my finger in there. Her reaction was immediate, as I felt her shimmy down a little more off the edge of the bed like she was trying to give me easier access. Her moans slowly turned into a mix of heavy breathing and squeaks as I continued licking and moving my finger in and out. One of her hands came off my head and started grabbing and ripping at the sheets, so I closed my eyes and upped the intensity to match her reactions. Before long she was pushing my face into her with both hands on the top of my head as she came. She came so quietly too, especially compared to other girls I&amp;#39;ve been with and even her own reactions leading up to it. She let out a quick initial &amp;quot;Oh my...!&amp;quot; which was followed up by waves of goosebumps and convulsions. Her hands actually swung up and smacked her stomach/chest a few times because of it. It was so fucking cute. I waited a few seconds and started poking around again with my tongue, but I heard her say, &amp;quot;Wait...gimme a second...&amp;quot; between short, quick breaths.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got up and slid onto the bed next to her, laying on my side so I could watch her. I started running my hand from above her chest all the way down along her legs and then back up a few times as her convulsions slowly subsided. I took that time to really take her all in and just admire how sexy she was. She finally opened her eyes, which had been closed tightly until then, and blinked a few times. I smiled down at her and said, &amp;quot;You ok? Feel good?&amp;quot; She smiled and closed her eyes again, letting out a long sigh. With her eyes still closed she said, &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m not exaggerating when I say... that was easily the best anyone has ever made me feel doing that&amp;quot;. I leaned in and kissed her as I continued running my hand all over. Before long, she grabbed both of my shoulders and pushed me as she struggled a little to get more vertical. She kept pushing me back as she swung a leg over me and got on top, pinning me to the bed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While everything in me wanted to keep going, and just ride that train all the way to wherever she wanted to take me, I made the decision to not go much farther than what we&amp;#39;d done already that day. I was thrilled she was being so forward, and the sight of her looking down at me from that position started chipping away at my willpower. But I didn&amp;#39;t want to rush things, which was not something I normally give a shit about. I wanted her first time, both with me and ever, to be a little more special than a quickie in her bedroom. &amp;#39;At the very least I owe her that much&amp;#39;, I thought to myself as I fought against the raging hard-on I had going.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As all that passed through my head, she had already worked her butt down to below my waist and was fidgeting with my belt. I grabbed her hands and pulled her up towards me, forcing her into a kiss. I could feel her hips moving a bit, grinding into me. She was making things very difficult. Maybe I should have just done what she wanted. But at the end of the day she is still my sister, and just wanting to get a piece of ass wasn&amp;#39;t the first thing on my mind, surprisingly. I forced myself to slow everything down.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I pushed her up into a sitting position and sat up, getting her legs stretched out behind me so she was in my lap facing me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me&lt;/strong&gt;: &amp;quot;Hey... Ash, that&amp;#39;s enough for today.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ashley&lt;/strong&gt;: &amp;quot;What?! But... you did all the work... that&amp;#39;s not fair!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me&lt;/strong&gt;: &amp;quot;I know, and trust me... I want all of you right now. It&amp;#39;d be very easy for me to keep going and let you do what you want... but let&amp;#39;s stop for now...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ashley&lt;/strong&gt;: &amp;quot;Oooooooohhh... fine.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She took a minute to run her hands over my stomach and chest a few times, biting her lip a little as she did. Eventually she brought both hands up around my neck and cupped my face as she leaned down and kissed me. She let out a frustrated noise and said, &amp;quot;You know... you&amp;#39;re a really good kisser.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me&lt;/strong&gt;: &amp;quot;Is that all I&amp;#39;m really good at?&amp;quot;, with eyebrows raised for effect.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ashley&lt;/strong&gt;: &amp;quot;No... it was all good. Everything felt so good... especially down there... (her hands slid down her stomach to just below her waistline and pressed in a little as she was talking)... But the way you were with me... everything was... oh my god, I&amp;#39;m getting excited just thinking about it.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I grabbed her by the waist before running my hands up and down her sides and across her chest too. She giggled as I grabbed what is barely a handful of her chest for a second on the way by.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me&lt;/strong&gt;: &amp;quot;You feel so good Ash... and you look even better. I definitely lost myself in you for a while. I was having too much fun making you squeak.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ashley&lt;/strong&gt;: &amp;quot;Oh my god, squeak? Is THAT what I was doing?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me&lt;/strong&gt;: &amp;quot;Uh, yeah. How else would you describe the sounds you were making?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ashley&lt;/strong&gt;: &amp;quot;That is definitely something a few guys have made fun of me for... before I dumped their asses!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We both laughed. I could tell she was happy. She didn&amp;#39;t stop smiling and it was having the same effect on me. I had to tell her how I really felt and ask her what she wanted to do. I could think of no better time or place to do that than while she was sitting there, smiling down from her perch on top of me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me&lt;/strong&gt;: &amp;quot;Ash, I love you.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ashley&lt;/strong&gt;: &amp;quot;I know!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me&lt;/strong&gt;: &amp;quot;No, I mean... I feel like an idiot for fighting my feelings. It took me a while to come to terms with you confessing everything the way you did to me. I had to allow myself to give in to the feelings you sparked inside of me. It gives me a knot in my stomach thinking about how long you&amp;#39;ve dealt with this. I&amp;#39;m sorry I never noticed that you were trying to clue me in for so long. But I know now. The thought of not even trying to make this work with you just seems... I feel like that would be a huge mistake. The feeling you give me scared the shit out of me at first, but I want more. More than might be possible. But I also know that I want to try to do this right. I don&amp;#39;t want to just... have sex with you and then pretend everything else is the same. I said I love you, but I am not just saying it because you&amp;#39;re my sister anymore. I want to explore all of this with you. We just have to do it smart, and make sure...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She was still smiling, but she started tearing up. She brought her hand up to my face and put the tips of her fingers over my mouth, so I stopped talking. She wiped her eyes and took a deep breath, shaking both hands in a fan-like motion towards herself to move some air around.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ashley&lt;/strong&gt;: &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m sorry... I&amp;#39;m sorry... I just need a second...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me&lt;/strong&gt;: &amp;quot;Seeing you cry is really tough, you know. It hurts extra to see you cry and know it&amp;#39;s because of me.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ashley&lt;/strong&gt;: &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m not upset right now though. I&amp;#39;m so happy. I just can&amp;#39;t even believe... you&amp;#39;re saying this to me. I never thought...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She started crying again. It was really becoming a theme with her. If anyone reading this wants to start a drinking game anytime she cries for future posts, I can basically guarantee you getting drunk by the end. All joking aside though, the feeling of knowing she was that happy was invigorating. I am unsure if I&amp;#39;ve ever had a girl cry tears of joy like that in front of me until my sister.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I put my arms around her and pulled her close, and she did the same. I kept talking as we hugged.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me&lt;/strong&gt;: &amp;quot;Ash, I want to do this right. There is no shortage of scary stories and comments online about how this can go really badly if we aren&amp;#39;t careful. And we really need to figure out what exactly we are going to do with... all of this we are trying to start here. I wasn&amp;#39;t going to do anything like what we did just now, not until after we figured all of this out first. But after we talked before, and you told me to kiss you, I just let myself go a little because I finally realized I wanted this too and just didn&amp;#39;t care anymore about the stuff that was holding me back. You broke me all the way down.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She just squeezed me tighter, saying my name slowly before, &amp;quot;I love you so much... I&amp;#39;ll do whatever, I just want you. Let&amp;#39;s try.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We stayed like that for a while. Eventually it became uncomfortable to stay sitting like that and we both got up and got dressed. She sat down on the edge of the bed and put her hair back up in a pony tail. I sat down in a chair and wheeled it over from her desk to the edge of her bed, similar to how we had been the first night I confronted her. How do you really even start a conversation about a secret relationship with your sibling? Apparently my sister already knew.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ashley&lt;/strong&gt;: &amp;quot;So... I think I have an idea.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me&lt;/strong&gt;: &amp;quot;Ok... I&amp;#39;m all ears because there is a lot that I am not sure of with regards to trying to work out the logistics here...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ashley&lt;/strong&gt;: &amp;quot;I think we should just be &amp;#39;dating&amp;#39;. That means no sleeping around, no going on other dates, etc. Like a... normal relationship. Ugh...I mean... same rules as if we were just...&amp;quot; She giggled a little, unsure of how to even classify what the fuck we were doing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me&lt;/strong&gt;: &amp;quot;I get it. I know what you mean. That&amp;#39;s obvious for me, because even if you were ok with it I wouldn&amp;#39;t want to keep sleeping around if I&amp;#39;m &amp;#39;with&amp;#39; you. I&amp;#39;m not like that.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ashley&lt;/strong&gt;: &amp;quot;Ok... well good!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me&lt;/strong&gt;: &amp;quot;Any ideas on all the other stuff?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She shook her head &amp;quot;no&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me&lt;/strong&gt;: &amp;quot;Well... I am worried mostly about my friends. They&amp;#39;d know something was up if I didn&amp;#39;t say something to them after breaking up with (ex-girlfriend). If they ask sometime soon, I&amp;#39;ll just tell them I am &amp;quot;staying single&amp;quot; for a while because the breakup was &amp;quot;rough&amp;quot;. But once that wears off, I think I&amp;#39;d like to try having you come and hang out with me and them once in a while. Like... I could tell them how we got drunk or something and you told me that you wanted to come hang out with me, and see what it&amp;#39;s like to party at a real university... just get them used to you being around so I don&amp;#39;t have to completely exclude you from that part of my life.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ashley&lt;/strong&gt;: &amp;quot;That might be nice... but I feel like we may want to save that for... much later. I really want to try going out, just the two of us, first. I need to make sure I&amp;#39;m not going to screw something up... like try to kiss you or something in public.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She is 4 years younger than me, but I am constantly amazed at how much more mature she is than me sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me&lt;/strong&gt;: &amp;quot;Listen... I am going to be right there with you hoping I don&amp;#39;t fuck anything up either. This is alllll new to me. But we can&amp;#39;t treat this like a game. This is serious.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ashley&lt;/strong&gt;: &amp;quot;What... about when we&amp;#39;re here?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me&lt;/strong&gt;: &amp;quot;I would say as long as Mom isn&amp;#39;t home then we are free to do whatever. But don&amp;#39;t forget I am going to be moving out. That&amp;#39;s probably only a few months away.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She got a look on her face like she had forgotten something important.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ashley&lt;/strong&gt;: &amp;quot;Oh... I forgot about that... oh man...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me&lt;/strong&gt;: &amp;quot;Hey, if anything it might make things easier. I promise to get an apartment with a door that locks on it!&amp;quot; I laughed, which prompted her to laugh as well. But I could tell that she was still concerned.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ashley&lt;/strong&gt;: &amp;quot;What if... What if we get more serious?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me&lt;/strong&gt;: &amp;quot;Then we&amp;#39;ll cross that bridge when we come to it. I can&amp;#39;t pretend to have all of the answers here, Ash. If anything, you&amp;#39;ve thought about this much longer than I have. But in talking with people and reading up on stuff, there are plenty of situations and people out there that work this sorta thing work. There are just some lines you can&amp;#39;t cross, ever. Worst case, if we&amp;#39;re worried, we could move or something. But I don&amp;#39;t want to get too ahead of ourselves here. Let&amp;#39;s see how it goes. When I figure out a date that I am going to move out, and then figure out where I am going to go, I promise we will talk again and figure it out. Until then... we should just see what happens, I think.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ashley&lt;/strong&gt;: &amp;quot;Ok... I&amp;#39;m good with that. So... no public displays of affection, no doing stuff when Mom is home, and no hanging out with each other&amp;#39;s friends and stuff until we are more... normal.&amp;quot; She giggled again at the &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot; thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After that we hugged and kissed for a while, and then made our way back out to the couch to watch some TV. Rest of the night was pretty normal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nothing really big has happened since then. We have fooled around a couple more times when time allowed for it, but we haven&amp;#39;t gone much further. We also went out to a movie, just the two of us. Things were fine and really we were mostly just &amp;quot;brother and sister&amp;quot; that whole time, no real awkwardness at all. But mostly I&amp;#39;ve just been enjoying watching her be so happy and open with me. I&amp;#39;ve also started retaliating against the ass slaps/kisses she has always done. I grab her and kiss her randomly all the time now, and not just little pecks on the cheek like she gave me for all those years. She&amp;#39;s told me that she always wished they were real kisses, so I&amp;#39;ve made that a reality for her and she has told me how happy it makes her on several occasions already.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To tell the truth I am still scared about a lot of this stuff, especially someone finding out, but I am also really happy. Easily the happiest I&amp;#39;ve been with a girl ever. And she has been walking on sunshine since our last talk. She&amp;#39;s been amazing, and we are really good together from what I can tell so far. It&amp;#39;s still early but I am optimistic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since we are taking things slowly, I don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;ll have anything steamy or any grand revelations for a while. I promise I&amp;#39;ll come back and give an update eventually once we have been together for a while or if anything happens and I need more advice. In closing, I&amp;#39;ll just ask that everyone reading this enjoy their lives and whoever is around them, no matter who they are.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit:&lt;/strong&gt; Typos and Grammar&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

A few replies to my last post were critical of how long it was, but really there isn't much I can do about it, since I have no way of artificially shortening this because I'm only writing what I experienced and was thinking. It wouldn't make any sense without my inner monologue from the whole thing either. So I just said \"screw it\" and posted it mostly unabridged. There IS apparently a 40,000 character limit to a reddit self post, something I wasn't aware of until trying to post this the first time, that caused me some grief at first. Had to remove one of my closing paragraphs to fit in the links to the past posts at the top! lol\n\nThanks for your comment and feedback! :)",

A few replies to my last post were critical of how long it was, but really there isn&amp;#39;t much I can do about it, since I have no way of artificially shortening this because I&amp;#39;m only writing what I experienced and was thinking. It wouldn&amp;#39;t make any sense without my inner monologue from the whole thing either. So I just said &amp;quot;screw it&amp;quot; and posted it mostly unabridged. There IS apparently a 40,000 character limit to a reddit self post, something I wasn&amp;#39;t aware of until trying to post this the first time, that caused me some grief at first. Had to remove one of my closing paragraphs to fit in the links to the past posts at the top! lol&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks for your comment and feedback! :)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

Just know that people move all around in their daily lives and just because you think you have covered the bases (gone somewhere else where you think your alone, and can let your guard down, thats when someone will walk around a corner and surprise you. But you can do it, and without putting a huge strain on your relationship. My cousin and I did it for years and nobody to this day ever found out about us. We arent together as a couple, never were, but we did a lot of stuff together and nobody ever questioned. And we found all the time we wanted to be sexual. Little different circumstance, but still, we had more of a sexual relationship, but same difference, you dont want anyone finding out or hinting. And as you get older, and life changes, you change friends groups, change jobs, change by moving, things will become easier to mask. \n\nYou put to words the very same concerns and feelings most anyone that ventures into this type of relationship, society has really driven us to think in our minds what is right, what is wrong and for what, when you look at all the acceptance of diversity in todays world, why is this lingering behind. Yeah I get the whole incest having kids things, but medically times have changed on all fronts. You hear more and more stories on here of people that have gone on and had kids and no side effects. Same as comparing it to life expectancy, look how much that has changed through modern medicine. I know thats way down the road for you two, but something down the road you will have to come to terms with. The numbers seem to be growing that this type of relationships is becoming more accepted, its a slow process, but hope is on the horizon, cause in the end, we are all men and women, and we are all decedents in our bloodlines. \n\nGood for you and Ashley for taking that step, more for you cause it sounds like Ashley was already many steps ahead of you.

It is clear that you have a tendency to get lost in your brain, to overthink every detail, and that analytical mind built a wall around your heart.  I empathized with your sister in the first half of this story.  You were initially treating her like a child.  Too much of your reservations were about \"protecting her,\" but in doing so, you were treating her like someone who needed to have her hand held, doubting her ability to understand and make decisions for herself.  As I read her replies, I was completely on her side.  She is an adult, and she has been dealing with these emotions for almost half her life.  She has had time to consider those questions and she obviously weighed the risks and was ready to start a relationship with you.  This is all inconsequential because you took the leap, but in thinking this out, your reasons for not pursuing the relationship should only be about you, about your reservations on your side of it.  It should not be about protecting her, because she can protect herself, and that condescends her.\n\nHowever, the frustration of your over-analysis and the way you essentially talked down to your sister gave way to an overwhelming warm feeling from when you finally gave in to your hearts desires.  You shut out all those doubts, and committed to your sister.  The way you told her side of the story, for how long she pined after you, and how frustrated she had become, for you to finally offer her what she longed for: it was beautiful.  It just awoke my romantic heart.  What an incredible love story!\n\nAnd then, when you started to treat her the way no man had ever done before, truly appreciated making her happy, cherishing every reaction she made: I am moved just replaying the events in my head.  You clearly love your sister, and she will be so happy if you consider her needs the way you did here.  Spend less energy on worrying for her and exert more of it on genuinely caring, because that can be far more positively impactful!  I am excited for your new journey, especially for your sister who has been waiting so long to embark on it!  I look forward to reading more stories of your wonderful relationship as it grows.",

It is clear that you have a tendency to get lost in your brain, to overthink every detail, and that analytical mind built a wall around your heart.  I empathized with your sister in the first half of this story.  You were initially treating her like a child.  Too much of your reservations were about &amp;quot;protecting her,&amp;quot; but in doing so, you were treating her like someone who needed to have her hand held, doubting her ability to understand and make decisions for herself.  As I read her replies, I was completely on her side.  She is an adult, and she has been dealing with these emotions for almost half her life.  She has had time to consider those questions and she obviously weighed the risks and was ready to start a relationship with you.  This is all inconsequential because you took the leap, but in thinking this out, your reasons for not pursuing the relationship should only be about you, about your reservations on your side of it.  It should not be about protecting her, because she can protect herself, and that condescends her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, the frustration of your over-analysis and the way you essentially talked down to your sister gave way to an overwhelming warm feeling from when you finally gave in to your hearts desires.  You shut out all those doubts, and committed to your sister.  The way you told her side of the story, for how long she pined after you, and how frustrated she had become, for you to finally offer her what she longed for: it was beautiful.  It just awoke my romantic heart.  What an incredible love story!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then, when you started to treat her the way no man had ever done before, truly appreciated making her happy, cherishing every reaction she made: I am moved just replaying the events in my head.  You clearly love your sister, and she will be so happy if you consider her needs the way you did here.  Spend less energy on worrying for her and exert more of it on genuinely caring, because that can be far more positively impactful!  I am excited for your new journey, especially for your sister who has been waiting so long to embark on it!  I look forward to reading more stories of your wonderful relationship as it grows.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

Especially with regards to love and relationships. If you've never had a significant other say something cheesy to you, then you haven't found real love yet! A certain layer of cheese has always been on top of the best relationships I've had, both in love and friendship. I'm sure there are plenty of people who go through life without ever experiencing that, but I'm not one of them. Perhaps my experience and what was said feels cheesy to you, but that's not because it's fake. Quite the opposite in fact. Most of what was said between me and my sister was embarrassing as hell! I'd never disclose ANY of what I wrote in person or to someone in real life. And I could have easily white-washed the cheesiness out of my experience, but then it wouldn't be what really happened anymore.\n\nAnd as for the typo: If a single typo in a post that long is all it takes for you to think it's fake, you must have a tough time reading other stuff! I find typos in official news articles almost every day. However, I'll strive to proof-read my reddit posts better if I post in the future :D\n\nThanks for your post and commentary, I appreciate you taking the time :)",

Especially since this post was mostly a followup for those who helped me out previously and I don't really need anymore advice right now. But I'm just wondering why you thought those lines you quoted were more ridiculous than others, such as me saying \"prepare yourself\" before going down on her, or the fact that I carried her into her room from the couch? I'm genuinely curious why you singled out those lines as being the reasons why you think the whole thing is BS? \n\nAlso, a bit of advice: if you've never tried biting a girls ear/lip or kissing/licking her neck/across her chest, I'd suggest you try it. I haven't ever been with a girl who didn't get turned on at least a little by that. Should work just as well if you're a woman on your boyfriend/husband/etc. I can't speak for other guys but anytime a girlfriend I had did that to me it was enjoyable as well.\n\nRegardless, thanks for reading and sharing your thoughts!",

Especially since this post was mostly a followup for those who helped me out previously and I don&amp;#39;t really need anymore advice right now. But I&amp;#39;m just wondering why you thought those lines you quoted were more ridiculous than others, such as me saying &amp;quot;prepare yourself&amp;quot; before going down on her, or the fact that I carried her into her room from the couch? I&amp;#39;m genuinely curious why you singled out those lines as being the reasons why you think the whole thing is BS? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, a bit of advice: if you&amp;#39;ve never tried biting a girls ear/lip or kissing/licking her neck/across her chest, I&amp;#39;d suggest you try it. I haven&amp;#39;t ever been with a girl who didn&amp;#39;t get turned on at least a little by that. Should work just as well if you&amp;#39;re a woman on your boyfriend/husband/etc. I can&amp;#39;t speak for other guys but anytime a girlfriend I had did that to me it was enjoyable as well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Regardless, thanks for reading and sharing your thoughts!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
