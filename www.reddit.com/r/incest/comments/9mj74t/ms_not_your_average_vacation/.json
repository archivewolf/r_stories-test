Every year we go on vacation.  Sometimes it\u2019s a resort, but recently we\u2019ve discovered how much we enjoy cruising (Caribbean usually). Our vacations are pretty a little bit scripted now, but it\u2019s a nice time to relax and just do whatever we want.  Usually we all do our own thing during the afternoon and evening, but we meet up for meals and excursions when we stop at an island.\n\n\nMy Mom always looked young for her age and it\u2019s not just me who thinks so, as per inappropriate comments from my friends and other individuals.  I\u2019ve always had a secret crush on her and even found some naughty pictures of her while I was on my Dad\u2019s computer in the past.  Before I begin this, I\u2019d just like to say that my mom is actively dating and has an active sex life (or so I assume).  She doesn\u2019t come home with random guys or anything, but all I\u2019m trying to get at is that she doesn\u2019t normally just go sleeping around.  Lately though, she hasn\u2019t gone out with anyone for 2 months or so.\n\n\nAnyway, it was a day at sea for the cruise and we\u2019re all just hanging by the pool, eating burgers and sun tanning.  My Mom is wearing this hot black two piece bikini and I casually check her out under my sunglasses.  While she\u2019s doing her thing tanning on a beach chair, a guy walks by an stubs his toe on her chair and accidentally spills some of his beer on my Mom.  I\u2019m naturally very protective of my Mom, so I jump out of my chair and start giving him shit.  He apologizes very quickly and runs off to get some extra towels for my mom to dry off with. As I see him run off, I can\u2019t help but notice how much he looks like me.\n\n\nAnyway, he comes back with a towel and starts to pat at where he spilled the drink on my Mom and she blushes a little.  After she\u2019s all dry, the guy (we\u2019ll call him Sam)\n apologizes over and over.  My Mom assured him that it\u2019s fine and that everyone should just go back to enjoying the cruise.  Sam and my Mom begin some small talk, like where we\u2019re from, occupations, how the cruise has been, etc.  \n\nWe learn that Sam came with his friend we\u2019ll call John.  They\u2019re both divorced men around my mother\u2019s age.  If you\u2019re wondering how I could possibly look like someone my mother\u2019s age, that\u2019s Asian genes for you.  We also learn that John had caught a stomach bug, so he\u2019s been quarantined to his room for the past 4 days.  This short encounter ends up with Sam being invited to our table for dinner.\n\n\nMom and Sam hit it off during dinner.  The conversation stream didn\u2019t seem to end and he was actually really fun to be around.  After dinner, Mom and Sam were walking around the deck, while my siblings and I decided to go to the arcade.  Maybe we seemed naive or stupid here, but I felt like I trusted Sam and my Mom always kept methods of protection on her.\n\n\nI got tired pretty early, so I headed back to my room a bit early.  I threw off my outside clothes and got into comfy clothing and turned on a movie.  Barely 10 minutes into the movie I heard Mom\u2019s door swing open (it\u2019s right next to mine).  I was going to go see how her night was, but I didn\u2019t want to break the suspense of the movie I was very engaged in.  \n\n\nHalfway through the movie I hear moaning noises.  Couldn\u2019t be my movie, it was a horror movie.  The noises get louder.  The time is only 9:30PM and every night, my siblings and I aren\u2019t back in our rooms until at least 1:00AM.  I curiously put my ear against the wall and hear that\u2019s where the noises are coming from.  Holy shit was I horny.  In fear of getting caught, I pause the movie and just listen. My Mom was getting fucked, hard.  Images of the hot sex poured into my mind and I eventually couldn\u2019t do nothing anymore, so I started jerking off and boy did I release a load.\n\n\nI clean myself up a bit and decide to get some air, so I go out onto the balcony of my room and start to read my book on my tablet.  I don\u2019t hear any more fucking, but I hear some light mumbling and giggling, so I assume things went well.  Anyway, some time passes and I hear Mom\u2019s balcony door open.  Mom and Sam talk about how much fun they had and what else they want to try.  I probably should have left at this point, but I kept listening.\n\n\nFrom what I gathered, my Mom wanted new and exciting things.  Her sex had always been very vanilla.  Missionary and doggy in bed only.  Sam pretty much suggests they try something different then and there.  My Mom giggles and goes \u201cOh!\u201d.  With a burning erection and curiosity I peek over the railing just a little bit and see my Mom\u2019s hands on the railing of the balcony.  She was moaning and shouting Sam\u2019s name.  Everything I could hear painted images of my Mom getting fucked on the balcony.  At some point during the sex, my Mom yelled \u201cOh *insert my name*!!\u201d Sam said \u201cwho is that?\u201d She told him to never mind and just go harder.  The sex lasted at least 20 minutes and I listened to every damn second of it.\n\n\nAfter all this intensity I heard Sam leave and my Mom went back to her room. I know I just released a load, but I was still so damn horny.  I took out some lube that I had an just went to town.  Now I don\u2019t know about you guys, but I\u2019ve never actually been caught masturbating before.  Right after I jizzed all over the paper towel my mom swings open the door in just heat underwear and a long bed shirt.  Great.  She begins to say \u201cHey *my name*\u201d, but stops mid sentence and turns beat red and darts out the door.  I wanted to die.  \n\n\nThe movie finished and I lingered around my room, thinking about what happened.  I decided I should probably talk about it with my Mom so I went over to her room.  The conversation was kind of awkward, but I pretty much just apologized for her seeing what she did.  She assured me it was ok and that was the end of that conversation.  As I was leaving she said \u201cHey, you know whoever gets that is really lucky\u201d, with her eyes averted and face all red.\n\n\nThat statement echoed in my head all night.  We got 5 more days of cruising so I\u2019m wondering if I can act on this.  Sorry, I\u2019ve never written here before, so I apologize if this was too long/detailed/vice versa.",
