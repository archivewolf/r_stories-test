NO, I will not show you what my wife looks like. If you couldn't tell over my posts I'm paranoid enough as it is, you really think I'm just going to give you a picture of my wife? No, don't ask me in the PMs again, please.\n\nSo, there are three things I have to talk about today, two of which I caught on camera while I was out on business for a couple of days this week and the third was because of my direct actions in intervening in the situation (I didn't catch them or anything, but I did cause some kind of development in the week). I have all of these clips saved to my secure location, and they are for sure the best \"pornography\" I ever have owned.\n\nBefore I begin, I also want to address something a few people were asking about in the comments to the last post, and that is my relationship with my wife. People questioned my view of our relationship and seeing her as a sexual object and that I might take her for granted, neither of those things are true. I love my wife for the woman that she is, she's kind, powerful and unique, and I'm lucky to be her husband. I talk about our relationship very plainly because I don't want to share those details too much, that's mine and my wife's to enjoy (yes I know these who post contradict that statement, but this is my fantasy/desire/project which I'm sharing, not the love me and my wife have).\n\nSo anyway, back to the three incidents, I'll go through them chronologically so you can have a kinda timeline of events. I need to inform people I was away on business from 1st - 3rd September and wasn't home (I had half a day off on Thursday 4th to go through all the footage that I'd missed) so I left on the morning of 1st September and came back on the night of 3rd September.\n\n**2nd October** - This was another day, as in the last post, he got up very early and I think it was to actually catch his mother naked again because after he got up, he heads straight to our bedroom, morning wood and all.  So he knocks on her door and then opens it quickly, but she's not there, so he decided to head downstairs to see if she's in the kitchen.\n\nShe is, and she's in what she was wearing the night before, her usual t-shirt and comfy underwear. He comes in and tries to act all causal whilst at the same time very obviously trying to get her to look at his morning wood. It's really funny, it was almost like watching a terrible TV show, and I feel kind of bad for him because quite quickly my wonderful wife calls him out on it.\n\n\"[Son's Redacted Name], do you want to do something with that?\" She's now pointing at it.\n\nThere's a long pause before he says anything.\n\n\"Why are you looking at it?\"\n\nMy wife then walks over to the door and says something which made me love her even more.\n\n\"Trying is always good, unless it's trying too hard, then it's just painfully obvious. I'll forget this ever happened.\"\n\nShe then just walks upstairs and goes to get changed into her work clothes. It was a funny interesting that showed me they're very obviously both playing a game.\n\n**3rd October** - Now, I won't spend too much time on this one, as it's similar to 26th September the week before, the same setup applies. My son playing a video game, my wife going out for her yoga class, this was before I arrived back from my trip, as I came home at about 9PM. So she comes downstairs and is getting ready to go and my son asks her something.\n\n\"Do you need me to stretch you out again?\"\n\nShe just laughs at him and replies.\n\n\"Wow, like father like son.\"\n\nThis is true, I do ask her if she needs help stretching out sometimes, and I do see the innuendo there, and yes it has been used in the past.\n\nSo they basically do the same thing I described last time, a nice closeness I loved watching, but this time it lasted for a while longer. I don't think I said last time, but it took them about 5 minutes to do last time, this time it took closer to 15 minutes, with my wife making up excuses to go over some of the more provocative poses, and my son taking the opportunity to look some more.\n\nAfter they both finished, they gave each other a smile and my wife gave him a kiss on the cheek.\n\n\"Till next time!\"\n\nThen she left, leaving my son all horny again. This time he went to his room and jerked off there. I can't see his bed through the camera, but I knew exactly what he was doing.\n\n**5th September** - So, this is where things really heat up, and this is also where I intervened a little in the proceedings, and I hope it's been for the best. So it was the morning, I was getting ready to leave for work, and my wife had just gotten up, and so was in the kitchen in her underwear and t-shirt combination. My son is not up yet, but I've been looking at the time he gets up, and he's getting up earlier and earlier to make sure he sees his mother in that t-shirt and underwear look, so I know he'd be up soonish, it was around 8:45AM at the time.\n\nI come out of my little office in the house (a tiny spare room for people who stay over) and am getting ready to go. I then see my wife up and say good morning and the thought rushes through my mind to do something. I decided that I should show my wife how much I love her in those clothes, which might make her wear them more often, and I thought I can slip some naughty talk in there as well. So, I put the few things I have in my backpack (I refuse to carry a briefcase) and then walk over to my wife, coming up behind her and placing my hand's either side of her on the counter, blocking her in my arms between the hard counter and my body.\n\nSomething I was reluctant to say before is we have a bit of a dom/sub things going on, not all the time, but it rears its head when we both want it to, and apparently, we both wanted it to at this moment, as she just let out a satisfied sigh and relaxed her body, ready for me to play with her. I gave her a strong hug with on arm, and she tried to turn around to kiss me, but I stopped her.\n\n\"No no, you'll get your kiss later, you haven't earnt it yet.\"\n\nI was so hard right then, but my plan didn' involve me getting off, but neither did it involve my wife fully getting off, so fair's fair. She just nods and grinds back on my nice hard-on.\n\n\"What do you want me to do, how does your good girl earn your kiss?\"\n\nI gently let my hand run down her body and finally got to her underwear where I begin to pleasure my wife through the fabric with my hand. She begins moaning and I start to talk dirty to her, about how she's being a bad girl, teasing me all the time and that kind of this, then I move on to the planned dirty talk.\n\n\"You like prancing around in almost nothing don't you?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"You like getting my attention, don't you?\"\n\n\"Yes!\"\n\nI rub a little harder, and I know that she's getting more and more turned on, but trying her best to keep quiet, as our son could be down at any moment. Then I decided to take a leap of *\"blind\"* faith.\n\n\"You like getting our son's attention don't you?\"\n\nShe gasps loudly as if I flicked a switch somewhere.\n\n\"I... I don't...\"\n\nI then take my other hand and gently place it around her neck, something I do to her a lot when we're in this kind of mood.\n\n\"Don't lie to me, I've seen how he looks at you, you must know, and you must like it as well.\"\n\nShe hesitates, breathing heavier than before and then letting out a long sigh as I tighten my grip just a little.\n\n\"Tell me the truth.\"\n\n\"Yes... Yes, I do.\"\n\nShe then grinds back heavier on me and I slide my hand inside her panties, now quite wet with all our playing. I slide a finger inside her and begin to build her up, and I know this isn't going to go on for much longer. While I'm playing with her, I'm listening for my son's door, and I hear it open and he walks towards the stairs.\n\n\"Looks like we ran out of time.\"\n\nI then pull away from her, giving her about 10 seconds to regain some semblance of motherhood, and I lick my finger in full view of her as I move over to the sink, then washing my hands as my son walks in. I then clean and dry my hands, and walk past my wife before giving her a light peck on the lips (but it was obvious she wanted more), and a light slap on her ass in front of my son (power more to motivate him, at least in my head).\n\n\"See you both, I'll be back normal time.\"\n\nThey both bid me fairwell and I get in my car and off to work I go.\n\nI then looked at the footage in some downtime I had yesterday, and it was promising. My son decided to flirt, like normal with my wife, and he decided to come next to her where she's still stood from before and tells her she looks great this morning. For the first time, my wife is speechless and on the back foot, trying to hide the damp patch on her panties.\n\n\"No, you don't have to honey.\"\n\nHe then showers her in compliments, saying she looks good in anything and she shouldn't feel ashamed of anything. During this, she moves away and turns away from him, but towards the camera, and all you see it her running her fingers over her underwear as he talks, her eyes close. He notices, but before anything else happens, she says she needs to go for her shower and to get ready. She then goes to our bedroom, an ensuite, and has a long shower, the coming out, getting dressed and going to work quickly. I was so lucky it all worked out that way, I could have gotten caught in so many ways, I felt like I was in a porno after I pulled it off. I'm so lucky to have an amazing wife.\n\nThat evening, our son was out, which just meant that I was basically pounced on by my wife that night, and we fucked everywhere, and we did things we hadn't done in years. Fucking her in the kitchen is something I want to do so much more of now.\n\nSo that's where I'm at, I think I'm making progress here, any comments are welcome, and I'd be happy to answer any questions you guys have about it all.",

For the first time, my wife is speechless and on the back foot, trying to hide the damp patch on her panties.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;No, you don&amp;#39;t have to honey.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He then showers her in compliments, saying she looks good in anything and she shouldn&amp;#39;t feel ashamed of anything. During this, she moves away and turns away from him, but towards the camera, and all you see it her running her fingers over her underwear as he talks, her eyes close. He notices, but before anything else happens, she says she needs to go for her shower and to get ready. She then goes to our bedroom, an ensuite, and has a long shower, the coming out, getting dressed and going to work quickly. I was so lucky it all worked out that way, I could have gotten caught in so many ways, I felt like I was in a porno after I pulled it off. I&amp;#39;m so lucky to have an amazing wife.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That evening, our son was out, which just meant that I was basically pounced on by my wife that night, and we fucked everywhere, and we did things we hadn&amp;#39;t done in years. Fucking her in the kitchen is something I want to do so much more of now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So that&amp;#39;s where I&amp;#39;m at, I think I&amp;#39;m making progress here, any comments are welcome, and I&amp;#39;d be happy to answer any questions you guys have about it all.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
