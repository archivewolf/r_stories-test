This is a very long post, so I hope you guys like reading!\n\nThings have remained fairly constant until recently. I'll get into that in a sec, but basically since my last post, my mom and I have been going to the basement and fooling around almost every night. She still won't let me do anything to her, but she has been getting more and more risqu\u00e9 and has even licked my cock a few times (still won't put it in her mouth though). She recently stopped getting fully nude, but that's only because about a week ago, we almost got caught by one of my sisters (mentioned below).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**A WEEK AGO (9/21):**\n\nIt was a Friday night around midnight, and I was getting my almost nightly handjob on the guest bed in the basement. Mom was between my legs, we were both naked, really getting into the handjob, like really more than usual. I guess we may have been making too much noise because my sister had started to come down the basement stairs before calling out my name and asking if I was alright. I told her I was and that I had someone in the basement so I'd like some privacy if possible. She must have realized what I meant, because she didn't continue down the stairs, but instead screamed out \"Oh sorry!\" and went right back up the stairs. Needless to say, it freaked my mom out and she actually stopped fooling around with me for a few days after that.\n\nWe eventually couldn't stop for too long because we were right back at it by Tuesday. My mom said we could continue, but that we had to set some rules, one of which was \"no more naked mom\". It sucked after seeing her naked for the past 2 weeks but she still allowed me to fondle her tits and ass during the handjobs so I didn't complain too much.\n\nThe other rules were just things like, keeping the door locked, making sure we knew when my sisters were gonna come home, and of course making sure my dad was asleep before doing anything.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Anyway, so fast forward to LAST WEDNESDAY (9/26):**\n\nIn my last post I mentioned how I had suspicions that my dad might know what me and my mom were up to. Well, it turns out he has NO idea. I would feel terrible if it weren't for something my mom told me. She told me that due to my dad's erection issues, they had set up a profile on Adult Friend Finder to try and find someone to help fill that void, but they hadn't had much success so they gave up. That was like 4 months ago that they set it up.\n\nMy mom told me that they heard about the site from one of their friends but that they never really put anything on their profile, so they never got much action on there. The night that my mom told me, I asked her for their username on the site and then I decided I'd set up my own account so I could message them. I know it's fucked up but everything I've been doing with my mom the past few months has been fucked up so I didn't think about it too much.\n\nSo I set up my profile, paid for a month subscription and then searched their username. I found it, clicked on it, and saw that on their profile, their \"about me\" section stated that they were a married couple with older children, the husband was in charge of the profile, and that he was trying to find someone young and hung for his wife to play with. It went on to say that if the husband approves, wife would be able to play solo.\n\nSo like I said, I had set up an account the night my mom told me, but she didn't know that I had set one up. Late that night, I had messaged their profile and said that I was interested. I got a message back in the morning (this past Thursday) and we continued to exchange messages for about a day before I got a message back asking to provide a full body shot. At first, I was a little worried because I didn't expect my dad to be so forward...also, I didn't know where I could take a pic like that without showing too much of my room and thus giving away who I was.\n\nI had the opportunity a few days later (Saturday) when I was at a friends house. I asked to use the bathroom, and when I was in their bathroom I decided to take a pic to send to my parents. I got myself nice and hard, then took a mirror pic that showed everything. When I got home, I edited the pic so that my face was entirely blurred out. That night, I sent the pic along with a few cock shots to my parents profile. I got a message back a few minutes later saying that he (my dad) would need to run this by his wife and see if she also approved before deciding how to proceed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**LAST NIGHT (SUNDAY):**\n\nLast night, my mom and I were in the basement and out of the blue she says she needs to talk to me about something serious. The conversation went like this (not the exact same words, but along the same lines):\n\n**Mom:** *Why are you fucking with your dad on AFF?*\n\n**Me:** *I don't know what you're talking about* (I totally knew what she was talking about).\n\n**Mom:** *Yes you do, cut the bullshit. He showed me your pics yesterday and asked me what I thought.*\n\nAt this point I started laughing, because this what I was hoping for when I started this whole AFF thing.\n\n**Mom:** *Why are you laughing, it's not funny. Why did you think this was a good idea? He had completely forgotten about the stupid website before he got your messages a few days ago, now he won't stop asking me if I want to meet \"a big dicked kid\"* (his words).\n\n**Me:** *Well, at first I was fucking around but then I realized if I could get him to approve, we could do more than what we're doing now.*\n\n**Mom:** *That's just evil, how did you even think of that?* (she seemed to start getting mad at this point)*. He keeps texting me throughout the day asking if I have made a decision, I don't know what to tell him!*\n\n**Me:** *Well, is he okay with it? like is he cool with letting you do stuff with someone else without him being there?*\n\n**Mom:** *Yes! That's why he won't stop asking! I think he feels bad for not being able to satisfy me sexually, so now he's trying so hard to fix it, which includes letting me \"fuck a big dick boy\"* (again, his words).\n\n**Me:** *Wait, would you really fuck me?*\n\n**Mom:** *No! That is out of the question. I told him I would think about it but that I don't think I would feel comfortable fucking someone else at this point.*\n\n**Me:** *Oh...*\n\n**Mom:** *He said it was okay that if I didn't want to, I didn't have to. Then he told me to consider just meeting you and maybe fooling around in other ways until I felt comfortable.*\n\n**Me:** *Ok, so what did you say?*\n\n**Mom:** *I told him maybe, but that I needed to think about it more. I just wanted him to stop asking. He said he was overwhelmed too, but equally excited and thrilled to finally have found someone that he thought would be a good fit* (pun intended).\n\n**Me:** *And?...*\n\n**Mom:** *Nothing else. We haven't talked about it since, I told him I needed one more night to think about it, but I'm hoping he'll just forget it all. Just stop messaging him for God sakes. It's already fucked up what we're doing, and now you're involving your dad, it's just not right. Keep him out of this.*\n\n**Me:** *But Mom, don't you see? If he is okay with it, and he doesn't want to know who the guy is, we can totally continue! With his blessing!* (My thought process...)\n\n**Mom:** *Enough, just stop messaging him please. We can continue doing this, but leave your dad out of it. Okay?*\n\n**Me:** *Fine, fine. I'll stop.* (At this point I started taking off my pants)\n\n**Mom:** *What do you think you're doing? I'm not in the mood for that anymore, you've really stressed me out with all of this, jerking you off is the last thing on my mind right now. I'm going to bed. If you stop messaging your dad, we can continue, if not, then I'm breaking this off and we'll never do anything again. Okay?*\n\n**Me:** *Okay...*\n\nAnd with that, she went upstairs, leaving me in the basement with a hard on and guilty feelings. I was so horny though, and that horniness overpowered any feelings of guilt, so I decided to try one last thing. I opened Snapchat, took a pic of my hard cock and sent it to my mom with the caption \"Imagine having this inside you\".\n\nAlmost immediately, she opened it and Snapchat alerted me that she was typing a message but I guess she erased it because she never actually sent anything.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TODAY:**\n\nThis morning I woke up to a message on AFF from my parent's profile that said. \"Wife wants to meet you this Friday. Let me know what time works for you. She wants to meet in public first so she can get to know you, then if it goes well, she will invite you to her hotel room. If you're serious, let me know ASAP. I'm not going to be with her, so be on your best behavior \\*winking emoji\\*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt took me the whole day to compose myself after getting that message. Like I seriously just replied to the message about an hour ago, before writing this post. My dad is still at work, so I don't expect to get a response until later tonight. I will update again, once I do.",

I opened Snapchat, took a pic of my hard cock and sent it to my mom with the caption &amp;quot;Imagine having this inside you&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Almost immediately, she opened it and Snapchat alerted me that she was typing a message but I guess she erased it because she never actually sent anything.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TODAY:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This morning I woke up to a message on AFF from my parent&amp;#39;s profile that said. &amp;quot;Wife wants to meet you this Friday. Let me know what time works for you. She wants to meet in public first so she can get to know you, then if it goes well, she will invite you to her hotel room. If you&amp;#39;re serious, let me know ASAP. I&amp;#39;m not going to be with her, so be on your best behavior *winking emoji*&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It took me the whole day to compose myself after getting that message. Like I seriously just replied to the message about an hour ago, before writing this post. My dad is still at work, so I don&amp;#39;t expect to get a response until later tonight. I will update again, once I do.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
