I would like to start by saying thanks for all the love and support. Lots of you are telling me that it's normal to have feelings for my son and that I shouldn't beat myself up for my inclination towards him. I've gotten a lot of encouraging messages telling me to open up more to him to find out for sure that he's actually attracted to me or if he was just horny. However, I wanted to make sure firstly that my attraction towards Ben isn't just my \"vagina talking\" since I haven't had sex with my husband in a while and that seeing an erect penis might have just just reignited my sex drive.  I'll try my best to illustrate how things played out to the best of my memory. I've broken this into two parts because I've been busy with work and other things in life (who isn't) and I don't want to keep you guys waiting. Part 2 will come out soon.\n\nIt has been around a week since that incident happened (where I caught Ben masturbating to my tanga panty) and I haven't really noticed any difference in Ben's temperament. When I got home from work, he would still greet me as usual and our small talks during dinner time were plain and normal. I can obviously see that he's still quite shy to see me and that he's a little tense when I make eye contact with him, but I think it's pretty normal all things considered. At the very least I'm glad that he is still embarrassed about what happened, it would be weird if all a sudden I kept \"catching\" him masturbate. Our family has never really been open to these kinds of things. Now that I think about it, I don't think neither my husband nor I have given Ben some sort of sex talk.\n\nI got advice telling me to try to have sex with my husband first to see if I'm still sexually attracted to my son afterwards. I thought that it was a good idea since I may just be horny (oops). My husband is very busy and spends most of his time working. He always comes home happy to see us, but too tired to experiment with anything adventurous with me. So I surprised him two days ago.\n\nOnce my husband got into the bedroom it was about 9:00pm. I was in our walk-in closet wearing a wireless lace bra and a garter set. Once I saw him settle on the bed, I slowly walked outside of the closet and made my way towards him. I tried my best to walk as seductively as possible while maintaining eye contact and giving him the \"fuck me\" eyes. His eyes widened in surprise and I saw him instantly have a hard-on. He's face showed a little smirk as he watched me crawl on all fours towards him on the bed. We passionately made out and it felt amazing at first... but it soon felt empty. Every kiss that he would give me didn't make me any more aroused. I was on my back now and he was on top. He took off my bra and started caressing my breasts while fingering me. He then proceeded to fuck me in a missionary position while I wrapped my legs around his body and my arms around his back. He told me how much he loves me and how grateful he is for all the things I've done for the family. I told him that I loved him back and I'm grateful for him too, but all I can think of is Ben and his cock in me.  It felt like I was cheating on my husband since I was thinking about another man (my son) while he fucked me. Thinking about Ben's cock in me while my husband was fucking me was so hot that I had one of my strongest orgasms yet. I moaned with every thrusting motion he made and when I came, my legs and arms squeezed my husband's body so tightly that he thought that I was trying to strangle him. When he finished, he thanked me and said I was great. He then asked me if I wanted to cuddle. I told him that I didn't want to, so he rolled over to his side of the bed. I laid there just looking at the ceiling motionless, my body was filled with so much pleasure that it was paralyzing. Visualizing Ben fucking me instead of my husband really gave me such a rush. It still felt wrong, but I know that I shouldn't really punish myself for feeling this way so I just accepted this feeling. I found out at this very moment that I did have a fetish for a mother/son relationship. I love Ben and I can't stop fantasizing on doing many things to him now that he's all grown up. Thinking about him masturbating to my panties really turns me on. The idea of being wanted by my own son does it for me in ways that I can't describe with words.\n\nIt was around 10:45 when I got up from our bed. I planned on talking to Ben with regards to the incident that happened last week. I want to know once and for all if he has feelings for me or if he was just horny.\n\nNote: I have already talked to him but I'll post how it went in part 2 :)\n\n\u200bEdit: here is part 2 [https://www.reddit.com/r/incest/comments/9alh9n/ms\\_teasing\\_my\\_son\\_and\\_giving\\_him\\_his\\_first\\_fresh/](https://www.reddit.com/r/incest/comments/9alh9n/ms_teasing_my_son_and_giving_him_his_first_fresh/)\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b",
