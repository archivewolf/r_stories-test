They are not blood-related to me, but they are just as close as family. I'd appreciate if someone could inform me if that would be allowed on this subreddit or if I would have to post those updates to my profile. Thanks in advance)\n\nSunday, August 5th. I (19) awoke to being jostled by Katie (18) again, beaming down as she held herself above me. \"Hey.\" she whispered. I smiled and greeted her back. She climbed onto the bed and rested her body on top of me. I wrapped my arms around her and we kissed slowly and deeply. My hands went right for her bottom, as they usually do, touching her bare thighs and tugging her pajama shorts up her ass. My sister groaned into my mouth, rolling her hips until she found my erection with her crotch and began to hump against it firmly. \"Mmm, you fucked me so good yesterday.\" she moaned quietly, then whispered, \"I'm not that sore anymore.\" I smiled and said that she should calm down, at least until Mom is at work, grunting a little from my manhood throbbing due to her grinding against it. Katie groaned again and pouted as her hips stopped moving, \"Mom is working from home today.\" (She has been known to do this occasionally) She sulked as she rolled off the bed, kissed me again and left my room. I got up and dressed before following her.\n\nThe three of us had breakfast and watched more \"Supernatural\" for a couple hours while Mom simultaneously tried to get some work done on her laptop (often getting distracted by the show, haha) I went up to my room afterwards to spend some time on the computer. It was less than an hour later when Katie bounced into my room and jumped onto the bed, rolling around a little as she told me that she and mom were going for a dip in the pool, and that I was welcome to join them. I smiled and said that I would get ready in a bit, seeing as the both of them would take longer to get into their swimsuits than I would. My sister grinned as she slinked off my bed, wrapping her arms around my chest from behind, \"I'm gonna wear my smallest, sexiest bikini, and you're gonna get a booo-neeer.\" she whispered in my ear in a sing-song-y voice. I snorted and told her that I would just catch her and finger her, making her cum in the pool. She let out an exaggerated gasp, followed up by, \"You wouldn't! Not in front of Mother!\" I gave her my best wide and devilish grin, \"Oh, wouldn't I?\" Katie bit her lip, her eyes darting to the door, \"You could give me a quick one right now.\" she purred softly.\n\nMy loins stirred. I told her to sit on my lap facing away from me as I swiveled my chair towards the door. My hand slipped down the front of her underwear before her bottom had settled on my crotch. Katie let out a soft sigh when my fingers came into contact with her clitoris, teasing it gently before feeling her labia were already dripping with her juices. \"Ohh fuck. Do you feel how wet you make me?\" she panted, rolling her hips so her ass rubbed against my swelling erection through our clothes. I kissed and nipped her neck and shoulder while my other hand went up her shirt, rubbing and massaging her breasts through her bra. I ran my fingers up and down between her vaginal lips, aroused even further by the soft, wet sounds filling the near-silent room. My sister moaned and pushed her hips forward as my fingers sank into her entrance, moving in time with them, her bottom rocking against my straining shaft. \"Seth..take it out. If we're quick..I think you can fuck me.\" she whispered breathily. I wasn't thinking cautiously, I was thinking with my penis, so I agreed. She stood and started slipping her bottoms down below her knees, bending over and giving me a good, close-up view of her puffy, flushed, noticeably wet vagina pressed between her thighs. Unable to help myself, I leaned in, brushing my lips against it and giving her a few good licks. She jolted, but held still, quietly begging for me to penetrate her. I unzipped my shorts and freed my aching member before stroking it.\n\nWe snapped back to reality when we heard footsteps on the stairs. Quick as a magician's sleight of hand, her bottoms came up and fastened, my erection was tucked away, pants zipped up and mouth wiped of my sister's nectar before she left my room. \"I told him.\" I heard her chirp cheerfully to our mother as she skipped passed. I made busy on my computer until I was sure our mom had gone to her room to change. I sighed in relief, \"That was too close for comfort.\" I mumbled to myself. I gave them some time to get ready ahead of me as I let my \"swelling\" go down, wondering if I should relieve the pressure myself to avoid any embarrassing moments. Katie came back once she was in her two-piece. It wasn't all that small, seeing as she used to buy them based on how cute they were, rather than grabbing men's attention, but she certainly filled it out well and it showed more skin than the last. She did a twirl so I could appreciate both the front and the back, leaning away and shaking her posterior at me enticingly. I grumbled that she wasn't helping my \"problem\" go away. She giggled, giving her bottom a firm smack and letting out a moan. I told her that if she didn't stop I might jump her and not care whether or not our mother catches us. My sister stood up and turned towards me, biting her lip while squeezing and rubbing her thighs together, looking both contemplative and aroused. My logical brain wrestled with my limbic system, unsure of which outcome I preferred. She shrugged and said, \"Maybe later.\" before walking away, making sure to pop her hips from side to side as she did.\n\nThat settled it, I was masturbating before going swimming. I quickly and quietly shut my door, deliberately locking it to avoid any cliche porn scenarios. I was briefly interrupted by my mother knocking on the door, but I told her that I was changing and would be down momentarily. I didn't need any visual stimulation. Katie had given me plenty with her teasing and our activities about 10 minutes earlier. I managed to ejaculate into some tissues within a couple minutes. Not a deeply satisfying, testicle-draining orgasm, but it would sate my desires for the time being. I cleaned up, changed into my swim trunks and snuck to the bathroom to relieve myself and flush the evidence. My head felt a little more clear by the time I reached the bottom of the stairs, feeling relaxed, energized and looking forward to some horseplay in the cool water. Mom was in the kitchen, sporting her usual full-coverage one-piece swimsuit and having a drink. \"Ooo, look at you Mr. Muscles. So handsome.\" she teased. I could feel my face warm up a little as my face split into a bashful smile on it's own (I get embarrassed when complimented by family members, other than my sister) I chuckled awkwardly and shook my head before commenting that she doesn't swim with us often. Mom rolled her eyes, \"Uhk. I know. I'm usually so busy, but Katie mentioned that she wanted to go for a swim, so I thought I'd join you two. It's been almost a year, I think.\" she said while smiling and looking out the window at Katie, who was already jumping into the pool.\n\nI went to get a bottle of water out of the fridge. Just as my fingers wrapped around the cap, I heard my mother exclaim, \"HOLY-!\" I jumped and whipped around in shock. Mom looked as if she was in shock herself, her hand over her mouth with her eyes as wide as they could be. I was a bit worried until she spoke again. \"Oh my g-\" she breathed, reaching out to my shoulder, \"Seth...who did this to you?\" she asked while turning my back to her slightly, her eyes and tone filled with concern. I realized, it was the scratches that Katie had left on me the day before. I felt my face and ears burning as I pulled away from her, trying to hide my back, but also not wanting to face her. I settled on putting my hands on the counter in front of me, tilted so my side was facing my mom as I looked down, feeling so foolish for not remembering something so...well, memorable. She let out a short, quiet gasp as if she realized how I got them, possibly tipped off from my embarrassment.\n\nWe stood in silence for a minute or two before she spoke again. \"It was Sarah, wasn't it? It's so OBVIOUS now. Staying up late, the remark about you tossing and turning in bed, wanting to go wake you.\" she said as she paced back and forth a little. I frowned, \"No, Mom. Good lord, why does everyone think that I am involved with Sarah?\" I was rather tired of the assumptions at this point. As soon as my mother opened her mouth again I interrupted, \"It's none of Katie's friends.\" She put her hands on her hips and cocked her jaw, \"Well then, who is she? I think it's only right that our families meet.\" she said while folding her arms. I struggled internally, trying to talk my way out of this, hopefully without having to lie. I sighed, \"I've known her for quite a while. It was yesterday. I met up with her while you were out. It was our first time together.\" (all technically true) My heart was pounding as my face still felt as if it glowed with embarrassment, \"I just...don't think it's the right time to bring our relationship out in the open.\" It felt just a smidge better talking about this, even if it was really vague.\n\nMom's expression softened and she seemed to relax, unfolding her arms before she gestured towards me, \"Turn around.\" she said calmly. I did as instructed, hearing Mom's soft footsteps approach me before I felt her fingers on my back, making some of the more serious scratches heat up and tingle from the pressure. \"Have you applied any cream or ointment?\" she inquired. I shook my head and mumbled \"No\". She sighed, \"Did your father ever give you..you know,\"The talk\"?\" she asked, sounding a bit annoyed from even mentioning him. I nodded, remembering the time he caught me making out with and fingering a girl in my room before he pulled me into the hallway to give me a few condoms and advice on pleasuring women. I was pretty embarrassed, but the girl was so mortified that she never came over again and stopped talking to me. It felt like a bit of an overreaction to me, but it was her choice. Mom sucked her teeth, \"Well, something must've stuck, seeing as it's obvious you know how to please a woman.\" she said crisply. It felt as if steam was rising from my head as I stepped away and turned to face her, \"Mom, please. I just..don't want to talk about all this right now.\" She held her hands up as if she was surrendering, \"Alright, alright. It's none of my business. Just..PLEASE tell me that you two are being safe.\" she said, going back to being concerned. I swallowed, looked my mother in the eye...and lied. \"Yes.\" I said, stone-faced. Mom smiled and sighed, \"Good to hear.\" she said before taking a step forward and raising her hand, \"And, um. Good..good job.\" she said awkwardly, patting the front of my shoulder while looking away. It was clear that she wasn't entirely sure what to do in this situation, and it was even more awkward than you can imagine.\n\nMom gave me a half smile and walked out the door to the backyard, my sister enthusiastically greeting her as I stood in the kitchen and wondered if this was going to complicate things. I mean, all my mother REALLY knew was that I was having sex with a girl that I had known for a while. There's not much info there to connect to Katie. I once again fell back to \"What will be, will be\" and strode out to the backyard as well. Mom had already swum to the far side of the pool and was relaxing on the set of stairs near the deep end, fanning and splashing water on herself. I walked down the shallow end set of stairs, Katie smiling and swimming right over. \"Just keep smiling.\" I told her softly, following my own advice. She smiled while also not showing concern on her face. I relayed the basics of what had just happened, and told her that she should act surprised and how she would normally react when I show her the scratches on my back. She agreed, gasping and laughing (quite convincingly) when I turned to show her my back. I acted embarrassed and told her to get it out of her system. She swam over to our mother, \"Oh my gosh, Mom! Did you see how Seth lost a fight with Wolverine?!\" before cackling. Mom chuckled and told her that she saw and to be nice. They spoke some more, too quiet for me to make out clearly. Katie glided back over as Mom sank deeper into the water and closed her eyes. \"So, are you going to change during the next full moon?\" she asked, apparently loud enough for our mother to hear because I saw her smile. \"Very funny.\" I said, splashing her after, making her squeak.\n\nWe played around in the pool for a while longer and spent some time just floating and relaxing before Mom said that she was going to make some lunch for all of us. Katie and I got out of the water to shower after our mother had already rinsed, dried and gone inside. We couldn't help ourselves, automatically coming together to kiss passionately and touch each other all over while rinsing off. I told her how sexy she looked in her bathing suit, developing a stiff, throbbing erection from seeing her bottom after I pulled her bikini up (I am noticing this is a habit of mine) She told me that seeing me topless and also knowing that Mom saw the scratches made her wet. \"Oh god, something IS wrong with me. I want to blow you so she'll come looking for us and see me with your cock in my mouth. Or walk in just as you're jerking off and cumming all over my face.\" she whined and groaned. I realized that *I* was able to cum earlier, but Katie was still carrying all of that carnal energy from before.\n\nI spun her around, her bottom pressed against my lap as I slipped my hand down the front of her bikini. She let out a sigh of pleasure as my fingers ran over her labia and clitoris, doing my best to make sure the buildup was enough for a satisfying climax, but also trying to make it quick. It only took a couple minutes before she was leaning back against me, hips thrust outward while panting and letting out moans that were increasing in volume (I guess it helped that she was already very aroused) My sister yanked her top askew so it exposed her breasts, taking my hand and placing it on one while my fingers were buried in her womanhood. \"Oh yes. Oh god. So close.\" she squeaked as I fingered her rapidly, her legs clamping around my hand as she pitched forward, gasping for air and grunting loudly. I covered her mouth and shushed her. She stuck her tongue out, licking and kissing my hand, grabbing it so she could suck my middle and ring fingers (arousing me further) as she panted, \"Don't stop. Keep rubbing.\" I did as requested, my arm starting to ache slightly, but it didn't take long before my sister experienced a second climax soon after the first. She panted heavily and groaned as she pulled my hand up, sucking her juices from my fingers before kissing me hungrily.\n\nWe separated and straightened ourselves up before sharing one more deep, slow kiss as I grabbed her bottom with both hands, making her moan again softly. Katie wrapped herself in her towel as she headed inside. I shut off the warm water completely and dialed up the cold water, opening the front of my trunks and groaning as the icy water cooled my burning loins. I shook myself and retrieved my own towel, drying myself as I walked back inside. Luckily, as soon as our mother had gone inside she went upstairs to get dressed before starting lunch, so she didn't know how long we took to rinse off. The three of us ate together, Katie and I sitting on our damp towels. We played cards and then went back to more \"Supernatural\" while Mom attempted to watch and get more work done. I was glad that things didn't feel so awkward now and that we could just have a normal, lazy Sunday together. After dinner, Katie asked if Mom wanted to play a game or watch more Netflix. She politely declined and said that she needed to go up to her room and put her nose to the grindstone if she was going to have all her work done on time.\n\nAs soon as we heard her door close, my sister scampered across the couch and flopped on top of me. We embraced and kissed, our tongues massaging one another as I ran my hand up her back, pushing her shirt up in the process. We had put a movie on as a cover, but we were only half watching, spending much of the time with our hands all over each other. We were able to hear whenever our mother opened her door, so we would part and compose ourselves before she came within sight. She came downstairs only about two or three times because she forgot something or to get a drink etc. The last time she smiled as she passed, seeing us cuddling together while watching the second movie we had put on. \"Goodnight. Don't stay up too late.\" she said while heading upstairs. Near the end of the movie, Katie and I kissed hungrily, grinding against one another as I had my hand down the back of her shorts. She pulled back and whispered, \"Let's go up to your room. I need you inside me.\" It pained me to say it, but I told her that it was safer to wait until the next day while Mom was at work. It felt like she might be more alert to the comings and goings of our bedrooms until the idea of me being sexually active fully sank in. My sister frowned and huffed and pouted while grinding herself on me, but I wasn't going to budge, it felt too risky.\n\nShe got up without kissing me first and went upstairs to get ready for bed. I sighed, turning off the T.V. while rolling off the couch before also going upstairs. She was in the shower. We had only rinsed after getting out of the pool, so we had yet to wash up. I gathered my pajamas and a towel before going back downstairs to use the guest shower, not wanting to bother Mom if I could help it. Once I was clean and dressed in my shirt and boxers, I slung my towel over my shoulder and strode back out to the living room. Katie was sitting against the back of one of the couches, wrapped in a bathrobe while her hair was still wet. She started when she saw me, then stood up, looking sheepishly at the ground. I tilted her chin up, her eyes sweeping up from the ground to my face as I did, her lips still holding a bit of pout in them as I gathered that she was feeling apologetic. I leaned down and we kissed over and over, her arms hanging at her sides until she reach up with one hand and placed it on my cheek. My hands slipped into my sister's robe. She was naked underneath. I shuddered and moaned, pulling her closer, my member springing to life in record time as we pressed together.\n\nI knew I shouldn't give in, but I wanted to please her. She was sitting on the back of the couch as I whispered, \"If you open your legs, I'll put it in.\" she exhaled suddenly, a moan escaping from her lips at the same time. My sister bit her lip and rubbed her legs together, her head lolling to the side while I kissed her neck. I could feel her trembling as my hand ran over her thigh and cupped her bottom. She put her hand on my chest and gently pushed me away, exhaling through pursed lips as she attempted to calm down. She shook her head slightly, \"No, you're right. It's not safe. I'm a good girl. I can wait.\" she said with a curl of her lips. \"I just came down to kiss my big brother goodnight.\" she pecked my lips again, then whispered in my ear, \"Don't jerk off.\" before turning around and silently going up the stairs.\n\nI groaned in exasperation as I looked down at the obscene bulge in my boxers, adjusting it to be less noticeable and holding my dirty clothes and wet towel over it to be safe. I tossed my laundry into my hamper before using the restroom, returning to my room to do some typing before bed (I was feeling more wired than sleepy) Sometime after midnight I heard a faint knocking on my door. I jumped, alt-tabbed and padded over to the door just as it was opening. It was our mother. \"Mom, that was barely any time for a response.\" I scolded her. She gasped and apologized, wondering if I had fallen asleep with my bedside light on since she saw it from under the door. I chuckled and shook my head, telling her to go to bed and that I would make sure to turn out the light when I started feeling sleepy. I managed to do some replies and complete a post that night before crawling into bed and drifting off.",

Thanks in advance)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sunday, August 5th. I (19) awoke to being jostled by Katie (18) again, beaming down as she held herself above me. &amp;quot;Hey.&amp;quot; she whispered. I smiled and greeted her back. She climbed onto the bed and rested her body on top of me. I wrapped my arms around her and we kissed slowly and deeply. My hands went right for her bottom, as they usually do, touching her bare thighs and tugging her pajama shorts up her ass. My sister groaned into my mouth, rolling her hips until she found my erection with her crotch and began to hump against it firmly. &amp;quot;Mmm, you fucked me so good yesterday.&amp;quot; she moaned quietly, then whispered, &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m not that sore anymore.&amp;quot; I smiled and said that she should calm down, at least until Mom is at work, grunting a little from my manhood throbbing due to her grinding against it. Katie groaned again and pouted as her hips stopped moving, &amp;quot;Mom is working from home today.&amp;quot; (She has been known to do this occasionally) She sulked as she rolled off the bed, kissed me again and left my room. I got up and dressed before following her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The three of us had breakfast and watched more &amp;quot;Supernatural&amp;quot; for a couple hours while Mom simultaneously tried to get some work done on her laptop (often getting distracted by the show, haha) I went up to my room afterwards to spend some time on the computer. It was less than an hour later when Katie bounced into my room and jumped onto the bed, rolling around a little as she told me that she and mom were going for a dip in the pool, and that I was welcome to join them. I smiled and said that I would get ready in a bit, seeing as the both of them would take longer to get into their swimsuits than I would. My sister grinned as she slinked off my bed, wrapping her arms around my chest from behind, &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m gonna wear my smallest, sexiest bikini, and you&amp;#39;re gonna get a booo-neeer.&amp;quot; she whispered in my ear in a sing-song-y voice. I snorted and told her that I would just catch her and finger her, making her cum in the pool. She let out an exaggerated gasp, followed up by, &amp;quot;You wouldn&amp;#39;t! Not in front of Mother!&amp;quot; I gave her my best wide and devilish grin, &amp;quot;Oh, wouldn&amp;#39;t I?&amp;quot; Katie bit her lip, her eyes darting to the door, &amp;quot;You could give me a quick one right now.&amp;quot; she purred softly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My loins stirred. I told her to sit on my lap facing away from me as I swiveled my chair towards the door. My hand slipped down the front of her underwear before her bottom had settled on my crotch. Katie let out a soft sigh when my fingers came into contact with her clitoris, teasing it gently before feeling her labia were already dripping with her juices. &amp;quot;Ohh fuck. Do you feel how wet you make me?&amp;quot; she panted, rolling her hips so her ass rubbed against my swelling erection through our clothes. I kissed and nipped her neck and shoulder while my other hand went up her shirt, rubbing and massaging her breasts through her bra. I ran my fingers up and down between her vaginal lips, aroused even further by the soft, wet sounds filling the near-silent room. My sister moaned and pushed her hips forward as my fingers sank into her entrance, moving in time with them, her bottom rocking against my straining shaft. &amp;quot;Seth..take it out. If we&amp;#39;re quick..I think you can fuck me.&amp;quot; she whispered breathily. I wasn&amp;#39;t thinking cautiously, I was thinking with my penis, so I agreed. She stood and started slipping her bottoms down below her knees, bending over and giving me a good, close-up view of her puffy, flushed, noticeably wet vagina pressed between her thighs. Unable to help myself, I leaned in, brushing my lips against it and giving her a few good licks. She jolted, but held still, quietly begging for me to penetrate her. I unzipped my shorts and freed my aching member before stroking it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We snapped back to reality when we heard footsteps on the stairs. Quick as a magician&amp;#39;s sleight of hand, her bottoms came up and fastened, my erection was tucked away, pants zipped up and mouth wiped of my sister&amp;#39;s nectar before she left my room. &amp;quot;I told him.&amp;quot; I heard her chirp cheerfully to our mother as she skipped passed. I made busy on my computer until I was sure our mom had gone to her room to change. I sighed in relief, &amp;quot;That was too close for comfort.&amp;quot; I mumbled to myself. I gave them some time to get ready ahead of me as I let my &amp;quot;swelling&amp;quot; go down, wondering if I should relieve the pressure myself to avoid any embarrassing moments. Katie came back once she was in her two-piece. It wasn&amp;#39;t all that small, seeing as she used to buy them based on how cute they were, rather than grabbing men&amp;#39;s attention, but she certainly filled it out well and it showed more skin than the last. She did a twirl so I could appreciate both the front and the back, leaning away and shaking her posterior at me enticingly. I grumbled that she wasn&amp;#39;t helping my &amp;quot;problem&amp;quot; go away. She giggled, giving her bottom a firm smack and letting out a moan. I told her that if she didn&amp;#39;t stop I might jump her and not care whether or not our mother catches us. My sister stood up and turned towards me, biting her lip while squeezing and rubbing her thighs together, looking both contemplative and aroused. My logical brain wrestled with my limbic system, unsure of which outcome I preferred. She shrugged and said, &amp;quot;Maybe later.&amp;quot; before walking away, making sure to pop her hips from side to side as she did.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That settled it, I was masturbating before going swimming. I quickly and quietly shut my door, deliberately locking it to avoid any cliche porn scenarios. I was briefly interrupted by my mother knocking on the door, but I told her that I was changing and would be down momentarily. I didn&amp;#39;t need any visual stimulation. Katie had given me plenty with her teasing and our activities about 10 minutes earlier. I managed to ejaculate into some tissues within a couple minutes. Not a deeply satisfying, testicle-draining orgasm, but it would sate my desires for the time being. I cleaned up, changed into my swim trunks and snuck to the bathroom to relieve myself and flush the evidence. My head felt a little more clear by the time I reached the bottom of the stairs, feeling relaxed, energized and looking forward to some horseplay in the cool water. Mom was in the kitchen, sporting her usual full-coverage one-piece swimsuit and having a drink. &amp;quot;Ooo, look at you Mr. Muscles. So handsome.&amp;quot; she teased. I could feel my face warm up a little as my face split into a bashful smile on it&amp;#39;s own (I get embarrassed when complimented by family members, other than my sister) I chuckled awkwardly and shook my head before commenting that she doesn&amp;#39;t swim with us often. Mom rolled her eyes, &amp;quot;Uhk. I know. I&amp;#39;m usually so busy, but Katie mentioned that she wanted to go for a swim, so I thought I&amp;#39;d join you two. It&amp;#39;s been almost a year, I think.&amp;quot; she said while smiling and looking out the window at Katie, who was already jumping into the pool.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I went to get a bottle of water out of the fridge. Just as my fingers wrapped around the cap, I heard my mother exclaim, &amp;quot;HOLY-!&amp;quot; I jumped and whipped around in shock. Mom looked as if she was in shock herself, her hand over her mouth with her eyes as wide as they could be. I was a bit worried until she spoke again. &amp;quot;Oh my g-&amp;quot; she breathed, reaching out to my shoulder, &amp;quot;Seth...who did this to you?&amp;quot; she asked while turning my back to her slightly, her eyes and tone filled with concern. I realized, it was the scratches that Katie had left on me the day before. I felt my face and ears burning as I pulled away from her, trying to hide my back, but also not wanting to face her. I settled on putting my hands on the counter in front of me, tilted so my side was facing my mom as I looked down, feeling so foolish for not remembering something so...well, memorable. She let out a short, quiet gasp as if she realized how I got them, possibly tipped off from my embarrassment.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We stood in silence for a minute or two before she spoke again. &amp;quot;It was Sarah, wasn&amp;#39;t it? It&amp;#39;s so OBVIOUS now. Staying up late, the remark about you tossing and turning in bed, wanting to go wake you.&amp;quot; she said as she paced back and forth a little. I frowned, &amp;quot;No, Mom. Good lord, why does everyone think that I am involved with Sarah?&amp;quot; I was rather tired of the assumptions at this point. As soon as my mother opened her mouth again I interrupted, &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s none of Katie&amp;#39;s friends.&amp;quot; She put her hands on her hips and cocked her jaw, &amp;quot;Well then, who is she? I think it&amp;#39;s only right that our families meet.&amp;quot; she said while folding her arms. I struggled internally, trying to talk my way out of this, hopefully without having to lie. I sighed, &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ve known her for quite a while. It was yesterday. I met up with her while you were out. It was our first time together.&amp;quot; (all technically true) My heart was pounding as my face still felt as if it glowed with embarrassment, &amp;quot;I just...don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s the right time to bring our relationship out in the open.&amp;quot; It felt just a smidge better talking about this, even if it was really vague.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mom&amp;#39;s expression softened and she seemed to relax, unfolding her arms before she gestured towards me, &amp;quot;Turn around.&amp;quot; she said calmly. I did as instructed, hearing Mom&amp;#39;s soft footsteps approach me before I felt her fingers on my back, making some of the more serious scratches heat up and tingle from the pressure. &amp;quot;Have you applied any cream or ointment?&amp;quot; she inquired. I shook my head and mumbled &amp;quot;No&amp;quot;. She sighed, &amp;quot;Did your father ever give you..you know,&amp;quot;The talk&amp;quot;?&amp;quot; she asked, sounding a bit annoyed from even mentioning him. I nodded, remembering the time he caught me making out with and fingering a girl in my room before he pulled me into the hallway to give me a few condoms and advice on pleasuring women. I was pretty embarrassed, but the girl was so mortified that she never came over again and stopped talking to me. It felt like a bit of an overreaction to me, but it was her choice. Mom sucked her teeth, &amp;quot;Well, something must&amp;#39;ve stuck, seeing as it&amp;#39;s obvious you know how to please a woman.&amp;quot; she said crisply. It felt as if steam was rising from my head as I stepped away and turned to face her, &amp;quot;Mom, please. I just..don&amp;#39;t want to talk about all this right now.&amp;quot; She held her hands up as if she was surrendering, &amp;quot;Alright, alright. It&amp;#39;s none of my business. Just..PLEASE tell me that you two are being safe.&amp;quot; she said, going back to being concerned. I swallowed, looked my mother in the eye...and lied. &amp;quot;Yes.&amp;quot; I said, stone-faced. Mom smiled and sighed, &amp;quot;Good to hear.&amp;quot; she said before taking a step forward and raising her hand, &amp;quot;And, um. Good..good job.&amp;quot; she said awkwardly, patting the front of my shoulder while looking away. It was clear that she wasn&amp;#39;t entirely sure what to do in this situation, and it was even more awkward than you can imagine.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mom gave me a half smile and walked out the door to the backyard, my sister enthusiastically greeting her as I stood in the kitchen and wondered if this was going to complicate things. I mean, all my mother REALLY knew was that I was having sex with a girl that I had known for a while. There&amp;#39;s not much info there to connect to Katie. I once again fell back to &amp;quot;What will be, will be&amp;quot; and strode out to the backyard as well. Mom had already swum to the far side of the pool and was relaxing on the set of stairs near the deep end, fanning and splashing water on herself. I walked down the shallow end set of stairs, Katie smiling and swimming right over. &amp;quot;Just keep smiling.&amp;quot; I told her softly, following my own advice. She smiled while also not showing concern on her face. I relayed the basics of what had just happened, and told her that she should act surprised and how she would normally react when I show her the scratches on my back. She agreed, gasping and laughing (quite convincingly) when I turned to show her my back. I acted embarrassed and told her to get it out of her system. She swam over to our mother, &amp;quot;Oh my gosh, Mom! Did you see how Seth lost a fight with Wolverine?!&amp;quot; before cackling. Mom chuckled and told her that she saw and to be nice. They spoke some more, too quiet for me to make out clearly. Katie glided back over as Mom sank deeper into the water and closed her eyes. &amp;quot;So, are you going to change during the next full moon?&amp;quot; she asked, apparently loud enough for our mother to hear because I saw her smile. &amp;quot;Very funny.&amp;quot; I said, splashing her after, making her squeak.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We played around in the pool for a while longer and spent some time just floating and relaxing before Mom said that she was going to make some lunch for all of us. Katie and I got out of the water to shower after our mother had already rinsed, dried and gone inside. We couldn&amp;#39;t help ourselves, automatically coming together to kiss passionately and touch each other all over while rinsing off. I told her how sexy she looked in her bathing suit, developing a stiff, throbbing erection from seeing her bottom after I pulled her bikini up (I am noticing this is a habit of mine) She told me that seeing me topless and also knowing that Mom saw the scratches made her wet. &amp;quot;Oh god, something IS wrong with me. I want to blow you so she&amp;#39;ll come looking for us and see me with your cock in my mouth. Or walk in just as you&amp;#39;re jerking off and cumming all over my face.&amp;quot; she whined and groaned. I realized that &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; was able to cum earlier, but Katie was still carrying all of that carnal energy from before.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I spun her around, her bottom pressed against my lap as I slipped my hand down the front of her bikini. She let out a sigh of pleasure as my fingers ran over her labia and clitoris, doing my best to make sure the buildup was enough for a satisfying climax, but also trying to make it quick. It only took a couple minutes before she was leaning back against me, hips thrust outward while panting and letting out moans that were increasing in volume (I guess it helped that she was already very aroused) My sister yanked her top askew so it exposed her breasts, taking my hand and placing it on one while my fingers were buried in her womanhood. &amp;quot;Oh yes. Oh god. So close.&amp;quot; she squeaked as I fingered her rapidly, her legs clamping around my hand as she pitched forward, gasping for air and grunting loudly. I covered her mouth and shushed her. She stuck her tongue out, licking and kissing my hand, grabbing it so she could suck my middle and ring fingers (arousing me further) as she panted, &amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t stop. Keep rubbing.&amp;quot; I did as requested, my arm starting to ache slightly, but it didn&amp;#39;t take long before my sister experienced a second climax soon after the first. She panted heavily and groaned as she pulled my hand up, sucking her juices from my fingers before kissing me hungrily.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We separated and straightened ourselves up before sharing one more deep, slow kiss as I grabbed her bottom with both hands, making her moan again softly. Katie wrapped herself in her towel as she headed inside. I shut off the warm water completely and dialed up the cold water, opening the front of my trunks and groaning as the icy water cooled my burning loins. I shook myself and retrieved my own towel, drying myself as I walked back inside. Luckily, as soon as our mother had gone inside she went upstairs to get dressed before starting lunch, so she didn&amp;#39;t know how long we took to rinse off. The three of us ate together, Katie and I sitting on our damp towels. We played cards and then went back to more &amp;quot;Supernatural&amp;quot; while Mom attempted to watch and get more work done. I was glad that things didn&amp;#39;t feel so awkward now and that we could just have a normal, lazy Sunday together. After dinner, Katie asked if Mom wanted to play a game or watch more Netflix. She politely declined and said that she needed to go up to her room and put her nose to the grindstone if she was going to have all her work done on time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As soon as we heard her door close, my sister scampered across the couch and flopped on top of me. We embraced and kissed, our tongues massaging one another as I ran my hand up her back, pushing her shirt up in the process. We had put a movie on as a cover, but we were only half watching, spending much of the time with our hands all over each other. We were able to hear whenever our mother opened her door, so we would part and compose ourselves before she came within sight. She came downstairs only about two or three times because she forgot something or to get a drink etc. The last time she smiled as she passed, seeing us cuddling together while watching the second movie we had put on. &amp;quot;Goodnight. Don&amp;#39;t stay up too late.&amp;quot; she said while heading upstairs. Near the end of the movie, Katie and I kissed hungrily, grinding against one another as I had my hand down the back of her shorts. She pulled back and whispered, &amp;quot;Let&amp;#39;s go up to your room. I need you inside me.&amp;quot; It pained me to say it, but I told her that it was safer to wait until the next day while Mom was at work. It felt like she might be more alert to the comings and goings of our bedrooms until the idea of me being sexually active fully sank in. My sister frowned and huffed and pouted while grinding herself on me, but I wasn&amp;#39;t going to budge, it felt too risky.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She got up without kissing me first and went upstairs to get ready for bed. I sighed, turning off the T.V. while rolling off the couch before also going upstairs. She was in the shower. We had only rinsed after getting out of the pool, so we had yet to wash up. I gathered my pajamas and a towel before going back downstairs to use the guest shower, not wanting to bother Mom if I could help it. Once I was clean and dressed in my shirt and boxers, I slung my towel over my shoulder and strode back out to the living room. Katie was sitting against the back of one of the couches, wrapped in a bathrobe while her hair was still wet. She started when she saw me, then stood up, looking sheepishly at the ground. I tilted her chin up, her eyes sweeping up from the ground to my face as I did, her lips still holding a bit of pout in them as I gathered that she was feeling apologetic. I leaned down and we kissed over and over, her arms hanging at her sides until she reach up with one hand and placed it on my cheek. My hands slipped into my sister&amp;#39;s robe. She was naked underneath. I shuddered and moaned, pulling her closer, my member springing to life in record time as we pressed together.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I knew I shouldn&amp;#39;t give in, but I wanted to please her. She was sitting on the back of the couch as I whispered, &amp;quot;If you open your legs, I&amp;#39;ll put it in.&amp;quot; she exhaled suddenly, a moan escaping from her lips at the same time. My sister bit her lip and rubbed her legs together, her head lolling to the side while I kissed her neck. I could feel her trembling as my hand ran over her thigh and cupped her bottom. She put her hand on my chest and gently pushed me away, exhaling through pursed lips as she attempted to calm down. She shook her head slightly, &amp;quot;No, you&amp;#39;re right. It&amp;#39;s not safe. I&amp;#39;m a good girl. I can wait.&amp;quot; she said with a curl of her lips. &amp;quot;I just came down to kiss my big brother goodnight.&amp;quot; she pecked my lips again, then whispered in my ear, &amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t jerk off.&amp;quot; before turning around and silently going up the stairs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I groaned in exasperation as I looked down at the obscene bulge in my boxers, adjusting it to be less noticeable and holding my dirty clothes and wet towel over it to be safe. I tossed my laundry into my hamper before using the restroom, returning to my room to do some typing before bed (I was feeling more wired than sleepy) Sometime after midnight I heard a faint knocking on my door. I jumped, alt-tabbed and padded over to the door just as it was opening. It was our mother. &amp;quot;Mom, that was barely any time for a response.&amp;quot; I scolded her. She gasped and apologized, wondering if I had fallen asleep with my bedside light on since she saw it from under the door. I chuckled and shook my head, telling her to go to bed and that I would make sure to turn out the light when I started feeling sleepy. I managed to do some replies and complete a post that night before crawling into bed and drifting off.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Also once you have experienced this i dont think either party could feel satisfied with another partner, you are who you are. Its a hard life but moving out going to university and working, i read a different background but they were secretly together for two years with heavy Catholic parents, but the past gave them a overly good relationship that turned into something deep, they both went to university lived in dorms she used her mothers maiden name for most things that was aloud, so they got to enjoy university as a true couple. But yeah they got caught in the act on a break and told once finishing university they were not to ever come back banished from the family. But this was a past tense story they said they had been together for 15 years and going strong. \n\nThe relationship you have described intimate and all, i was 21 and got with a girl that took my breath away at 15, later i caught up casual fb chatting, but one day i said i have a superpower you know just being a idiot joke. After ages of her asking what and just dumb stuff i go my superpower is to satisfy, she replied oh yeah prove it. I accepted the challenge and because of her university lived 4hr drive she was 19, but i got there and stayed three nights. Because after the fb challenge i mentioned i was a nypho never meeting a soul to keep up she also was one thus the second challenge born. I won haha but she could keep up, but for a 19yr old she normally got with 30yr+ and told me she had been with over 50 people. Nerve racking but she was ready to settle down finished with night club days and hook ups living in one of her parents property's, i hated clubs. But i had planned to move across the country before all this had my tickets ready quit job. I stayed a week once cleaning cooking, helping her after work and uni. Really never been so happy watching her giggle and smile, once the move got closer her room mate was leaving and she said forget the move live with me you can use the spare room as your office. I ran away from a tight bond love scares me i normally get with people i like but can forget, she was even happy for long distance. I cut the thread and after six years i miss that feeling. I became trans later worked so hard on cardio, business prep, with full time job and cleaning up after being with my partner now because of events i lost my rare dream car that basicly was an investment, in two years it has gone up just over half what i paid, it was also rarer than i thought. But 2016 lost everything i saved ended in debt, lost a great place i rented, appendix blew with no leave left from work after borrowing money for my audi, i then end of year back to fitness wanting to tone, but still able to pick 70kg ok, little i knew i got bad lung infection after health got to the point i could hardly more after a shower, i couldn't breathe. I lost everything years of research and preparing for international business launch, health and money. Retreated home with my partner planning just a temp stay but after thousands on meds and doctors i didn't think i could loose the one thing i fear getting fat, i went from normal 70kg to 160+ in three weeks due to a tiny pill after new dr found what was wrong. Lost everything.\n\nJust been such a long time since experiencing romance, but i will say if you both intend to make this a relationship worth holding onto so you don't hurt each other and the new partners if going that way. Is this worth protecting can you see a future can she see one with you because the longer it goes on you both need to know each others intention, also being prepared or living out of home. But it's probably best if serious to both let your mom know, not everyone is narrow between the ears also the shit about genetic defects is 8% compared to the standard 4% it also has higher chances like anyone having history of mental problems disabilities in the families. Like anything people love and need to label everything because it must, titles to feel better objects to show others. Like can you or her imagine being long distance or moving on calling it a faze, can you picture other woman in her role without thinking of her. Even if you try to let go she might be unable to. Not everyone has to know but certainly if you don't have a prison sentence from it like some stupid places, Germany hilter put in the act of prison time, their was a bro sis couple that had children long story short they had massive disabled and mentally unstable brothers and sisters out of eight most had problems the dad tried killing him when younger. But they use that to say siblings can't live normal lives, some say as long as they don't have kids, man its mostly bullshit, also England put in a policy in 2003 making it illegal to be even with a step sibling. England and Germany royal families for generations kept things in order to marry siblings. But that's when you get defects, its from generations doing it repetitive. I've heard of many sibling families with more than one healthy family. Also sex with a different race was shunned only like 60-70yrs ago, same as single parents. It is great that you take some time to write some stuff that happens I'm sure the relationship is far more intense than what you have time too type. \n\nSorry for all the random crap, just food for thought. You both would have good communication, i do wonder if you go out and just do dates and such, because just seems like you just laze around the house with each and not seeing a movie or just, or is it really just a sexual thing that is temporary and has no motive of being something. Just jealous, I'm scared of that deep passionate love feeling I felt it twice and ran both times. Now i get to lay here alone waiting to get a ton of surgery, hopefully i can create a manga to get published. I have a great brother sister story that's got awsome twists, a gyaru yuri one, a transgender one having hard time figuring out the middle and one i know should have a chance of publishing in Japan at least, will take a bit to recover strength in my arm.\n\nSorry i find reading peoples experience and different mind sets and information they hold can help with things in the now past or future. I hope you let us know better details about the foundation of your relationship, if this is practice for novel writing or not, i like to believe there is truth it always makes me wonder my reaction if i had a sister and if my eyes would have opened to her, as it is rare but it sounds like the bond and sex are built and suited for each other, like jigsaw pieces \n",

I won haha but she could keep up, but for a 19yr old she normally got with 30yr+ and told me she had been with over 50 people. Nerve racking but she was ready to settle down finished with night club days and hook ups living in one of her parents property&amp;#39;s, i hated clubs. But i had planned to move across the country before all this had my tickets ready quit job. I stayed a week once cleaning cooking, helping her after work and uni. Really never been so happy watching her giggle and smile, once the move got closer her room mate was leaving and she said forget the move live with me you can use the spare room as your office. I ran away from a tight bond love scares me i normally get with people i like but can forget, she was even happy for long distance. I cut the thread and after six years i miss that feeling. I became trans later worked so hard on cardio, business prep, with full time job and cleaning up after being with my partner now because of events i lost my rare dream car that basicly was an investment, in two years it has gone up just over half what i paid, it was also rarer than i thought. But 2016 lost everything i saved ended in debt, lost a great place i rented, appendix blew with no leave left from work after borrowing money for my audi, i then end of year back to fitness wanting to tone, but still able to pick 70kg ok, little i knew i got bad lung infection after health got to the point i could hardly more after a shower, i couldn&amp;#39;t breathe. I lost everything years of research and preparing for international business launch, health and money. Retreated home with my partner planning just a temp stay but after thousands on meds and doctors i didn&amp;#39;t think i could loose the one thing i fear getting fat, i went from normal 70kg to 160+ in three weeks due to a tiny pill after new dr found what was wrong. Lost everything.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just been such a long time since experiencing romance, but i will say if you both intend to make this a relationship worth holding onto so you don&amp;#39;t hurt each other and the new partners if going that way. Is this worth protecting can you see a future can she see one with you because the longer it goes on you both need to know each others intention, also being prepared or living out of home. But it&amp;#39;s probably best if serious to both let your mom know, not everyone is narrow between the ears also the shit about genetic defects is 8% compared to the standard 4% it also has higher chances like anyone having history of mental problems disabilities in the families. Like anything people love and need to label everything because it must, titles to feel better objects to show others. Like can you or her imagine being long distance or moving on calling it a faze, can you picture other woman in her role without thinking of her. Even if you try to let go she might be unable to. Not everyone has to know but certainly if you don&amp;#39;t have a prison sentence from it like some stupid places, Germany hilter put in the act of prison time, their was a bro sis couple that had children long story short they had massive disabled and mentally unstable brothers and sisters out of eight most had problems the dad tried killing him when younger. But they use that to say siblings can&amp;#39;t live normal lives, some say as long as they don&amp;#39;t have kids, man its mostly bullshit, also England put in a policy in 2003 making it illegal to be even with a step sibling. England and Germany royal families for generations kept things in order to marry siblings. But that&amp;#39;s when you get defects, its from generations doing it repetitive. I&amp;#39;ve heard of many sibling families with more than one healthy family. Also sex with a different race was shunned only like 60-70yrs ago, same as single parents. It is great that you take some time to write some stuff that happens I&amp;#39;m sure the relationship is far more intense than what you have time too type. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorry for all the random crap, just food for thought. You both would have good communication, i do wonder if you go out and just do dates and such, because just seems like you just laze around the house with each and not seeing a movie or just, or is it really just a sexual thing that is temporary and has no motive of being something. Just jealous, I&amp;#39;m scared of that deep passionate love feeling I felt it twice and ran both times. Now i get to lay here alone waiting to get a ton of surgery, hopefully i can create a manga to get published. I have a great brother sister story that&amp;#39;s got awsome twists, a gyaru yuri one, a transgender one having hard time figuring out the middle and one i know should have a chance of publishing in Japan at least, will take a bit to recover strength in my arm.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorry i find reading peoples experience and different mind sets and information they hold can help with things in the now past or future. I hope you let us know better details about the foundation of your relationship, if this is practice for novel writing or not, i like to believe there is truth it always makes me wonder my reaction if i had a sister and if my eyes would have opened to her, as it is rare but it sounds like the bond and sex are built and suited for each other, like jigsaw pieces &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
