This is a repost since the original was taken down. \n\n\n\nHonestly I don\u2019t know if this is the right place to post this or if I should post this at all, but I need to ask for advice anonymously. A couple of days ago my sister started acting weird. She would avoid me and when we ate meals together she wouldn\u2019t ever look at me for any reason. Later that night I woke up to her groping my crotch. I didn\u2019t move at all when I woke up because I was so stunned at what was going on, and I barely opened my eyes, so I don\u2019t think she knew that I had woken up. A few seconds after I woke up she stopped and then left. \n\nI honestly have no idea why she started acting this way. It was literally like a switch. One day she was normal and the next she was completely different. She has still been acting strangely around me since that night, but she hasn\u2019t snuck into my room and groped me again to my knowledge. \n\nI honestly have no idea what\u2019s going on. I don\u2019t want to tell my parents or ask a psychiatrist because I don\u2019t want her to be embarrassed or feel attacked or anything. I just want to help her and figure out what\u2019s going on. I\u2019m seriously worried about her. Any advice would be much appreciated. \n\n\n\nThis is a repost of my original post. I no longer need advice on this matter, I and simply reposted it since it was taken down and so people know what\u2019s going on. \n\nI will repost part two after the 12 hour limit is over. \n",
