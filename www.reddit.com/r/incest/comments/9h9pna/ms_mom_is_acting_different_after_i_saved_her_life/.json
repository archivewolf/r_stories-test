I heard my mom screaming and begging him to stop (our house is small) and I grabbed our shotgun and came out pointed it at him and told him to put the gun down, he ended up shooting the kitchen cabinet and running out. We called the cops and they had a manhunt for him and he got caught the next day, charged with a bunch of shit.\n\nI don't think I saved my mom mainly because when he shot in my direction rather than shooting back I ducked. But my mom tells everyone in our little town that I saved her life. The way she tells it I was Rambo, the big hero who saved the day.\n\nAnyway, my mom has been acting much differently since all that. And I've had a crush on her and I'd fuck her if she's down but I just don't know if I'm imagining it. She's pretty fine, reddish brown hair, green eyes, big tits, nice ass, flat stomach.\n\nShe says shit like \"you're the only man I need\" \"you're the man of the house now\" \"you're the only man I need.\"\n\nWe used to just occasionally hug but now she kisses me on the cheek.\n\nShe asked me to sleep in her bed. Originally it was because they didn't catch my stepdad until the next morning and she was worried about him coming back that night, so I slept in a sleeping bag on the floor. Then she said my back would hurt and offered I sleep in the bed with her. I refused and she said she \"really didn't mind\" and said we used to sleep in the same bed when my dad would go on the road (I'd be 4 or 5, I don't remember this). \n\nSo we sleep in the same bed and originally she wore grey t-shirts and gym shorts but now she wears like these slim nightshirts that goes down to her thigh. And she lays her arm on me and shit when she's sleeping. And she'll get hot in the middle of the night and kick a leg out of the covers and I'll see this long leg sticking out of my bed. I mean seriously.\n\nI get serious morning wood and I've thought about just pulling my dick out and seeing what she says or does but I honestly don't know if this is like sexual or if she's just stressed because of what happened. What do y'all think?",

Think of her as you would any other girl you wanted to woo. If there was a girl at your work, you wouldn't whip out your dick and ask \"what do ya think?\". Well, I guess you could, but you'd be fired immediately and probably have to talk to some police about lewd behavior.\n\nNo, you'd romance her. So do that for your mom. Make dinner for her one night. Tell her how beautiful she looks when she's getting ready for work or something. Bonus points when she's not trying to make herself look better than usual. When she kisses you on the cheek, kiss hers back. Watch TV with her and offer to rub her feet after a long day. \n\nIt sounds like she would be receptive to this, and is maybe unsure if you feel the same.
