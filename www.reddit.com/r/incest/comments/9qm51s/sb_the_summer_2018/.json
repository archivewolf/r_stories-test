It gave me a great opportunity to spend more time than I usually had been with him. My fianc\u00e9 also took a trip with his brother and cousins so I was able to have a small getaway with my brother. Something we haven\u2019t been able to do since we took a cruise awhile back. \n\nEven though painting isn\u2019t exactly fun, being able to spend hours at a time at his new place was worth every second of it. Beyond the sex just being able to eat meals together, kiss, hold each other, watch movies cuddled up on the couch. I cherish those moments with him. It\u2019s been hard with a fianc\u00e9 getting as much time alone with my brother as I used to and it makes my heart feel heavy. \n\nOur little getaway was amazing, we had 5 days and 4 nights where we could actually publicly display our relationship. It felt so incredible to do so after all the hiding and sneaking around we usually have to do. Being in another state I think solidified our relationship, being able to kiss and hold hands in public. Flirt and act like a couple, it was so much fun. Sleeping in the same bed after sex, waking up to each other. God I wish it was always that way. \n\nAt the end of summer I had such a close call, no one suspected anything but still. We were at a relatives wedding, had been drinking a little too much. My fianc\u00e9 went to bed kind of early and I went down to the hotel bar to meet my brother late that night. My dad and some uncles were down there drinking too. My brother texted me and said he wanted me so bad, did I wanna meet him in his room in a few minutes. That he\u2019d go up before me and I could say I had to get back before my fianc\u00e9 woke up and wondered where I went. \n\nI never made it back to my room that night, I ended up falling asleep with my brother. Somehow I woke up before it was ridiculously late but I guess stirring to get dressed I woke him up. He went to ask where I was going in such a rush and I told him I had to get back to my room and hope my fianc\u00e9 wasn\u2019t awake yet. He was upset I had to leave, in a moment of poor judgement I started to kiss my brother goodbye and when I did one thing led to another and I was on my knees taking him in my mouth. I knew it\u2019d be at least a few days until I could see him again and it wasn\u2019t enough so instead of letting him finish I got up, took my pants back off and thought he was gonna fuck me but instead he started to go down on me. He\u2019s amazing but I had to stop him and tell him we really didn\u2019t have time, so I pulled his head up and told him to lay down. I got on top and rode him as wildly as I could.\n\nBy the time I made it back to my room my fianc\u00e9 was awake. I had did my best to try and say that I didn\u2019t come back last night because I didn\u2019t wanna wake him, by the time I left the bar with my dad, uncles and brother it was late. I thought it was best to sleep in my brothers room. That he got a cot and slept there and I slept in the bed. He bought it, still though I looked rough and luckily he didn\u2019t want to have morning sex before the ride home because I still had traces of my brother evident by my underwear.\n\n",
