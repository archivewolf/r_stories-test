For some reason with male only fantasies, I don't like Dad/Son or Uncle/Nephew, probably cause my own male relatives were homophobic, thus I prefer Stepdad/Stepson.\n\nThat said, I don't exactly feel any attraction to my own family members, except maybe when I was 14 and had a crush on a 2nd cousin I met for the first time at a gathering, but I quickly got over it.\n\nNow to give more detail, I'm also adopted and an only child. Thus it makes me curious if these could also play factors in enjoying these fantasies. I know part of the attraction is the taboo, but another part which makes me question myself is that I do enjoy the fantasy of \"showing familial love and closeness through sexual pleasure\" too.\n\nThis can probably be seen that some of my other fantasies involving fictional family members willingly sharing each other(ex. Dad and I sharing mom) to show our love.\n\nMy dad passed away a few years ago, so while I'm not attracted to my mom, I sometimes get turned on by the fantasy of sexually pleasuring a fictional mom for raising me as a widow and I try taking over my father's duty.\n\nI know everyone has their fetish, but sometimes I feel ashamed at anyone ever finding out.\n\nI know I'm preaching to the choir, but thanks for listening.\n\nEdit: Sorry if this reposted, had to add a tag.",

Life went on like normal afterwards.\n\nI think the thing you need to take away is that as long as it's consensual you shouldn't feel ashamed. I too would be worried if someone found out about it, but at the same time I'm not going around yammering on about it.\n\nAnd for you, it doesn't seem to be anything more than just a fantasy.
