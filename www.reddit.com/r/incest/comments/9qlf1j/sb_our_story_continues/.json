It kept up that way for a few months though it eventually turned into way more. Fucking became intimacy, love making, so much beyond sex. There were many times we would fuck but it evolved into so much beauty. So much more. \n\nSo I had met my now fianc\u00e9 about 6 years into mine and my brothers ongoing relationship, which means we\u2019ve been together 4 years now. My brother and I, we always knew we couldn\u2019t become public so always left the option of dating other people on the table. My brother had a child 2 years ago also, with a serious girlfriend. Anyway, my fianc\u00e9 and I for the most part are a normal couple, though ever since this past summer I\u2019m doubting everything. How do I marry this man when my brother is the one I want to spend the rest of my life with? \n\nAll through my relationship with my fianc\u00e9 I\u2019ve found different reasons and excuse to spend time alone with my brother, like I always have. I feel like I\u2019m marrying him because it\u2019s what is expected of me to do at my age. It\u2019s almost like smoke and mirrors, my brother and his daughters mother have been on and off ever since but are incredible co-parents, great actually. I get jealous but know it\u2019s what\u2019s  best for everyone. Just like I know my brother gets jealous of my fianc\u00e9. \n\nThis past summer my relationship with my brother started to get riskier, like bolder almost. We never had any close encounters with being found out but still, our seeing each other became much more frequent. I\u2019ll continue more with that on my next post. ",

Yes, the risk is very high when both siblings carry the same degenerative gene as a \"carrier\", but normally the risk of a sibling couple in their twenties having a baby with defects is substantially less than that of a couple who are biologically unrelated but the woman in her middle to late thirties. Also, \"positive\" genes will enhance each other, and that is how some geniuses were born out of parents who were biologically closely related (for e.g. cousins),\n\nSecondly, when you write \" Just like how men and women cannot procreate within the same gender\" is is also untrue since this \"reason\" has no bearing on inbreeding.\n\nSex has evolved from it's original prime purpose, namely for procreation (breeding), to the present situation where it is accepted as a mutually satisfying and enjouable experience between two consenting adults.",
