We always said after the first few months of realizing this was something we wanted badly that we knew it couldn\u2019t be labeled. We were younger then, so we had no idea it was ever going to be as deep and serious as it got. At that time though we said we could date and pursue other people as long as we always came back to one another. So I started dating a guy in college and we are actually engaged now. My brother has had some girlfriends and actually fathered a child by one of them. Yet we still find ways to be together when we can without risk of jeopardizing our seperate lives. Especially since we know the consequences. In all honesty if I knew what this would have become I may have stopped it earlier, either that or I never would\u2019ve agreed that we should pursue other people as long as we remained together in the end. The worst part is for the last year or so he\u2019s been begging me to leave my fianc\u00e9 and to go with him. To just move out of state and be a family, me him and his child. A big part of me has been contemplating it but it\u2019s harder now that he has a kid. Because that means family would come visit, how would it look if we shared the same bedroom? Why would I be living with him? A lot of thought and covering ourselves would have to go into it if I did make this jump. So I can\u2019t say definitely we\u2019re trying to be together, we\u2019ve always been together but the possibility is out there that I could go. I love him beyond love I have for my fianc\u00e9 or even our own parents. Because it\u2019s a different love, multiple levels of love.",

We always said after the first few months of realizing this was something we wanted badly that we knew it couldn\u2019t be labeled. We were younger then, so we had no idea it was ever going to be as deep and serious as it got. At that time though we said we could date and pursue other people as long as we always came back to one another. So I started dating a guy in college and we are actually engaged now. My brother has had some girlfriends and actually fathered a child by one of them. Yet we still find ways to be together when we can without risk of jeopardizing our seperate lives. Especially since we know the consequences. In all honesty if I knew what this would have become I may have stopped it earlier, either that or I never would\u2019ve agreed that we should pursue other people as long as we remained together in the end. The worst part is for the last year or so he\u2019s been begging me to leave my fianc\u00e9 and to go with him. To just move out of state and be a family, me him and his child. A big part of me has been contemplating it but it\u2019s harder now that he has a kid. Because that means family would come visit, how would it look if we shared the same bedroom? Why would I be living with him? A lot of thought and covering ourselves would have to go into it if I did make this jump. So I can\u2019t say definitely we\u2019re trying to be together, we\u2019ve always been together but the possibility is out there that I could go. I love him beyond love I have for my fianc\u00e9 or even our own parents. Because it\u2019s a different love, multiple levels of love.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
