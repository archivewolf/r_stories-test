He has always had a talent for writing, but I never  thought he could be so...descriptive. I have read these posts several  times now, and I have to agree they are exciting. It was like reading an  excerpt out of Shades of Grey. (I don\u2019t know why I say that. I haven\u2019t  actually read it. People told me it was erotic. I assume this is what  erotic novels are like.) Yes, it\u2019s a little weird that it\u2019s about me. I  told him I\u2019d like to read other stories if he\u2019d write them. Writing (about sex?) is an unusual talent I wish I had. Spoiler alert: There is absolutely no  sexual content in this post, so if that is what you are looking for, you  can move along.\n\nBy the way, I don\u2019t  think I look like an \u201cAmy\u201d though, not sure why he chose that, but  whatever. David is common enough, but he was right not to use my real  name. Also, I noticed he wrote that I called him \u201cDave\u201d a few times. I  never call him Dave. It\u2019s always David. Maybe he just hears it that way.  Ok, I just wanted to add some context. I know this is a taboo subject,  and I fully understand why it is. As a sexual fetish, I think incest is a  bit odd to me, but who am I to judge now? (Obviously.) Maybe it is the  \u201cforbidden fruit\u201d aspect of it for some people. I don\u2019t personally see  it that way between us, and I don\u2019t think David does, either, however  weird that may sound. I read a few of the other stories on here, and I  have to say they did nothing for me in that regard. Just reading about  sex is definitely something I can get on board with, though. I am going  to try to explain all of this from my perspective.\n\nDavid  left a lot of the conversation out, which is fine, but I wanted to add  some of it back in. He definitely captured the \u201chighlights\u201d I guess, so  that part I have to say was accurate. Also, he made it sound like peeing  in front of people is something only I do. He forgot to mention the  part where he peed in front of me while I was taking a shower. Just like  we both have a million times before when we shared a bathroom. I have  never understood why any of that is a big deal. Everyone pees. It all  comes out of the same parts. We all have the same parts. Everyone needs  to just chill about peeing. Anyway, here is some additional context, in  case you read David\u2019s post and thought this was all sexual. It\u2019s not. (I  mean, obviously, it is, but not lustful. In case that distinction  matters. It does to me, which is why I am writing this.)\n\nDavid  and I grew up in a totally normal upper-middle-class family. By that, I  mean our dad has a good corporate job, my mom has been a flight  attendant forever, and having seniority in that job makes a big  difference. Our parents both travel a lot for work, so David and I  learned from a very young age to be self-sufficient. We can both cook,  for instance, I\u2019d say above average, because we had to do that from an  early age. We both know not to take tremendous personal risks that would  cause one of our parents to have to come home early to bail us out of  jail or the hospital. As a result, we just grew up with a lot of  freedom, but that came with responsibility, which for me meant focusing  on doing well in school, which I did. I knew I was doing it to the  exclusion of certain childhood experiences, but life is one big trade  off anyway, and I figured I\u2019d be a happier adult if I had a stronger  foundation to start from.\n\nI didn\u2019t get to  college and all of a sudden go crazy, like some free-spirited hippie. I  consciously decided that there were certain areas where I would push  myself out of my comfort zone so I could grow a little. I think that is  part of the growth experience in this stage of my life. Taking my  clothes off in public is a good example. If you have never done it, you  cannot understand how exhilarating it is. You feel, well, naked, but I  mean metaphorically, and there is something empowering about feeling  comfortable in your own skin. Maybe more importantly to me, I have  always tried to embrace what our parents told us over and over: Nothing  that anyone thinks of you actually matters. It is how you feel about  yourself that matters, and the way you feel good about yourself is by  being honest with yourself. I may be taking that to an extreme by  getting sexual with my brother, but even there I think David did a good  job of explaining our shared mentality about that.\n\nHere  is what David couldn\u2019t have written because I had never really  discussed it: Being a woman is different. From the time I was twelve  years old, I was aware of the way men \u2013 I mean grown men \u2013 looked at me,  and not just me, every girl. At first it is really creepy, and then it  gets worse from there. The older you get, the more emboldended they  become. The catcalling starts when you get a little older. Then it turns  into pushy guys who just want to talk to you and cannot take a hint  that you are not interested. Do guys have to think twice about what they  wear to the gym? No. I do. Every girl does. I have to be careful going  for a jog at night because some wacko may decide to try to rape me, so I  go in the morning light. Even guys I have dated I have sometimes been  cautious with. Date rape is a real thing. Do guys have to wonder about  how far their girlfriends might push them sexually one night? No. Girls  do, particularly young ones with less experience.\n\nWhat  I am trying to say is that I have been aware of myself as a sexual  object since I was younger than I should have. I have also been taught  to be wary of the objectification of women for just as long. Even today, in college, there are posters up telling women to be aware of their surroundings and to not put themselves in compromising situations. I  don\u2019t see any posters aimed at guys that say, \u201cDon\u2019t rape people, you assholes.\u201d At my school, girls in sororities must take provided  transportation to and from organized parties and they must be home by midnight. I wonder why that rule doesn\u2019t apply to guys. I won\u2019t be joining a sorority and I won\u2019t be looking to a fraternity for a boyfriend. I think every woman reading this right now can relate to what I am saying.\n\nBecause of all this, I have taken it slowly in the sex department. It is not that I am not a sexual  person. I am - maybe more so now than ever before. But that is not a  reason to start sleeping around indiscriminately. What hasn\u2019t caught up  with my increasing openmindedness is my guarded attitude. It\u2019s just really hard to unlearn that, and I am not sure I even want to. And so when it comes to feeling comfortable in a sexual way around guys, that is going to be a journey. That\u2019s probably a good thing.\n\nDavid  did a good job explaining our relationship. It is nearly impossible to  understand if you haven\u2019t been a twin, but it is like there is an  extension of yourself in the world, just like David said. I feel 100%  comfortable around him. I trust him 100% with everything. I don\u2019t think  of him as a \u201cguy\u201d objectively in that he is not an object of desire the  way I have felt about other guys in the past. The difference is that it  might take years to get to a level of comfort and trust with a guy that  even approaches where I am with David. This whole \u201cco-masturbating\u201d  thing is kind of a joke between us now, but it is also 100% true what  David said. I don\u2019t see it as lustful, and neither does David. I see it as sexual, for sure, but not so much in a shared way. I am expanding my sexuality intentionally, and David represents a safe space to test that  out, kind of like a focus group. That may sound strange, but we cannot be the only related people in the world who have ever done something  like this. I mean, if two brothers masturbate together while watching  porn, it doesn\u2019t at all mean they want to have sex with each other. I  assume that happens. It has to. Just because we are of the opposite sex doesn't change things that much.\n\nI will admit that the whole oral thing was a spur of the moment thing. It was  exactly as David described it. I just found myself in the situation, and  I was really turned on, and it just happened. It was not premeditated  at all. I don\u2019t regret it. Afterward, we discussed it, and we agreed  that if you are going to play sex games, you\u2019re going to get some sex on  you, so to speak. We both have boundaries, but I was pretty sure that  was a big one for me, and I skipped right over that red line, so who  knows? I also never thought I would ask my brother to go down on me, but  I am absolutely going to ask for that again! Again, it  has to do with comfort level. I had a boyfriend do that before, but I  never felt comfortable telling him what to do. I cannot really explain why. When it comes to \u201cthings you have always wanted to know but were afraid to ask\u201d David is my opposite sex representative, and I sure as hell don\u2019t mind being his.\n\nOk I just  re-read everything I just wrote and I am still not sure I am clearly communicating what I am trying to communicate. We should leave the  writing to David, I guess. But I will leave you with this: In the space of just a few months I have gone from \u201cpretty conservative\u201d to opening my mind and pushing myself out of my comfort zone. That I have a sort of clone to get me through some of the more interesting parts is just the  way it turned out. David will tell you he feels the same way. For as  reserved as I have been, David might best be described as shy, so this  new normal is fully consensual, and it is good for both of us. I know  that for sure. And if it ever gets outside either of our comfort zones,  we have agreed that we can just pull the plug.\n\nAnyway, thanks for reading.",
