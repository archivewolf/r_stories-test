Me and her had a huge fight on whos fault was it and after that we stopped talking to each others. Last year we started talking again and became closer but both of us never talked about the past and pretended it didn't happen. I'm actually fine with it. I just want my sister back. I want us to be close but not sexually close. Not that I don't think she's not attractive. She is.\n\nAbout a week ago we were hanging and sending weird pics to each others. I jokingly sent her a pic of my hairy legs to send to other guys who ask her for nudes. I was really joking. It wasn't sexual. She said that would scare them more and sent back a non nude similar picture of her legs and she was younger in it. Around the time we were both being abused. We both sent pics like this to that guy but I thought all of it was lost. She still have them. She went on and said that she went back to him a few times after we fought.\n\nFor the next few days we talked about how fucked up it was and how it messed us up. I told her i'm bi and I prefer men now. She told me her weird fetishes which I also share. Then we started sharing porn and it's like we're ten years ago.\n\nBefore a week ago we weren't that close. We never talked about real stuff. In the course of a week we had the most meaningful conversations we ever had. We got a lot closer.\n\nI know if we went on like this something would happen between us. And i'm really worried about that. I'm afraid that sex would create resentment between us like before and i'll lose her for good. Or it would remind us of our horrible past and we won't be able to look at each others again. I don't want that but I also don't wanna say no to her because that would hurt her and might drive us apart again. Also, I would be lying if i said I don't want the same. And i don't think if she started something that i'll be able to say no.\n\nI love her, I really do and I don't wanna lose her ever again.\n\nAnyone can relate? Any advice? I'm looking for serious answers.\n",
