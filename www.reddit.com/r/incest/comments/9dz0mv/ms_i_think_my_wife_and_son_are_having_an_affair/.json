Now, I need you to know something first, everything I'm about to say is very very theoretical, I have no evidence for any of this, but I just have a feeling about it all. I'm obviously going to explain the situations to you, but with each one, you could very easily wave it off in one easy way or another, but it's the fact they've all happened recently is just a little suspicious to me.\n\nFirst of all, I'll get it out of the way, I do have a little bit of an incest fetish myself, which is why I'm posting here to begin with. I've lurked here in the shadows, and honestly, a lot of the stories I've found attractive, so there is some part of me that is a little turned on. I am however not a massive one fuck cucking, I do consider myself the opposite (and I'm sure my wife would have agreed as well).\n\nSo the first detail is that after coming home from finishing university, our son was much more open about himself with us both. He asked if he would wear what's comfortable and that at times, that might be a little revealing. We both agreed, and to be honest, that's actually fine, it's his attitude that's more... flirtatious with his mother. She decided that she'd wear whatever she wears to bed the night before at breakfast (if she's not in a rush for work). Now she did this when our son was away, which I of course liked, but I just think her in a t-shirt and underwear with our son in a similar state of dress is really, well... appropriate.\n\nAnother thing to do with her clothes is that my wife has started to keep on her work out clothes a little longer after her workouts/dance groups, now these aren't *majorly* revealing, but definitely show off her ass, they have been the star of many a great time for us over the past few years. She also gets dressed a little earlier than normal for these lessons, and she doesn't even hide that she's getting dressed early, just kinda announces it.\n\nAlso, I need to just add before my final point, I work a little further away from home than my wife does, and my hours is a little longer. Our son hasn't got a job and stays at home currently. So this means that they have time to spend together, normally I just come back to them chatting, I've not seen anything suspicious there, apart from our son's overall flirtiness.\n\nThe last point is what I believe to be the most compelling point, and that is the little matter of my wife's sex drive. See, normally for the past few years, we've fallen come to an agreement, we both still love each other and we both know that we're very much sexually active (we're in our late 40's/early 50's). We don't have a schedule as such, but we definitely have a regular cycle for each other's needs, usually about 2-3 days for both of us. The thing is since my son came back, I noticed our regularity change, now I am always on call. I could very well go for 5 days without anything but myself of pleasure, then an entire weekend of sex with my wife. Now I've not noticed any patterns with this and the patterns of my son, so I really have no idea.\n\nListen, I know the most obvious answer is talk to my wife, and I will, I just... I wanted to ask you guys if there was anything you see her, am I going crazy and this is normal, or is there something I'm missing?",
