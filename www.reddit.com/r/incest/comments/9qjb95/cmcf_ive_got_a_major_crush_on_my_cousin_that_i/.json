                        "selftext": "So my cousin and I have always been fairly close.  She is the daughter to my moms brother, and we are about 6 years different in age (i'm the older one).  She purchased a house a couple years ago and she knew I was looking at moving to her new area anyways for work so she asked me if I wanted to possibly rent a room from her.  I said sure and we've been roommates ever since.  It's just a 3 bedroom/2 bath house so we have a decent amount of room to ourselves. \n\nI guess I should say that my cousin as always had the body type that I adore, she's a little chubby with big tits, and I've always gone for that type (if you look at my post history you can see I'm not exactly a small guy myself).  We don't really talk about relationships much but she has told me she's only been with a few people and my sexual history is absolutely nothing to brag about.  Like the title says I've had a crush on her for a long time, and other than probably staring for a little too long at times I don't think she is super aware of it.  \n\nAlthough she has been seemingly teasing me more recently.  Like she has worn nearly sheer shirts without a bra (which has caused me to stare even more and also has been stored in the old spank bank), she bends over more often with low cut shirts allowing me a good look at her cleavage, and has started showering with her door wide open when she knows I'm home. \n\nThe most recent thing though is that she was on vacation a couple weeks ago with her moms family and texted me that she thought she had left her go pro charger behind and asked me to look in her room for it.  She thought it was either on her dresser or in her nightstand.  It's not uncommon for her to forget something and ask me to look for it but she generally knows exactly where it will be so I can locate it easily.  It was a little odd that she was very non-descriptive about where it would be but I didn't really think much of it at the time and started looking for it.  I checked her dresser first and didn't see it so I checked the nightstands and in the second one I didn't find the charger but did find a black satin bag with a cord sticking out of it so I picked it up.  When I looked inside what I had found instead was a 6-7 inch long blue vibrator with a usb charging cord.  I immediately felt guilty about finding it but also felt really turned on as well.  For some reason I decided to smell it and give it a lick but it didn't really smell and had likely been cleaned before storing.  Then I put it back, and texted her that I found a charger but it wasn't the one for her go pro, and she thanked me for looking and that she had wound up finding it in her luggage after all.\n\nShe's been back from her trip for a few days now, and obviously I haven't said anything about what I found, but I have been having mental images of her using the toy on herself every time I masturbate.  I cum so very hard when I do, and wish I could just watch her use it on herself or possibly join in with some mutual masturbation (and possibly more, but I have no idea if that will ever be a possibility). \n\nAny thoughts on what (if anything) I should do about this situation?  Should I let her know about what I found?  Could she possibly have wanted me to find it?  Or should I just never mention it and continue on with how things have been?",
