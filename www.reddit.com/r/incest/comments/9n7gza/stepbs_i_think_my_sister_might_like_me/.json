Her sister is my uncles child, the older one shares the same mother different father. They came from a very broken home, they were around drugs and was in a bad living situation. There was a history of abuse for both of them, and the older one now suffers from PTSD, anxiety, and is very impulsive. She goes to therapy often to help with these issues. \n\nSo i said all that because ive always took interest in incest, I liked the connection that brother and sister have and bringing that to a new level but I never had anyone in my family I was attracted to, until we adopted my sister the oldest which ill refer to as Amy is my age (18) and the other is 11. Amy is very beautiful and its hard not to notice, but I've never thought about doing anything with her till just recently as our relationship has grown and we've hung out a bit, gone to movies and such. I've noticed every time she's with me she always wears something pretty revealing, and everytime we are at the movies she's always cuddling with me. Last night it was a bit different, we went out to eat at like 8 (she wore something revealing) and then after went to a movie and she cuddled with me, and after that we went home she came into my room(never does that) we hung out for a bit then we kinda just laid on the floor and she began touching me and rubbing my back, and later on she laid on me. I know I may be reading into some of this, and its not in great detail but I just need advice. I do think shes attractive, but at the same time I dont want her doing something she might regret or something that would set her back in therapy. ",
