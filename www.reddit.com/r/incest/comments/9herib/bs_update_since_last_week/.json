                        "selftext": "This is an update since last week. For the full run down, see my previous posts. In short, my sister and I had a sexual relationship from the time we were young until a couple years ago. We stopped for the last two years and now have started talking/flirting again. Last week, my sister sent me a video of her vagina with a wink at the end and then she had business to take care of.\n\nAfter she sent me the video I had a lot of thoughts and wanted to start badgering her about restarting our sexual relationship, but figured I should do what I learned  from the MGTOW group. \"Masturbate twice and then make a decision.\" So I did.\n\nIt gave me a chance to relax and clear my head. So I went to the gym and decided to focus on cardio as I find it a great way to zone out and just think about things. \n\nI came to following question, what would happen if we got caught? I will outline my reasoning here.\n\n1. What would it mean for my sister. So let's say that we got caught, either with texts or in the act or by some way. Obviously, my brother in law would leave my sister and he would have every right. She has been fucking someone else, the fact that it is her brother will just make it worse for him. So he would leave her and, since she would be having a \"degenerate\" relationship with her brother, he would have a right to take his daughter (my niece) away from my sister. If he managed to have proof, he could use that as leverage in the court to get full custody, easy. Not to mention it would then leak out to our parents, friends, etc... that my sister and I have been having sex since we were kids. While she and I don't find anything wrong with it, the rest of the world does. In short, it would mean a complete destruction of her life. \n\n2. What would happen to me. Not much. Being that I don't have a wife (anymore) or kids, nothing much would directly happen to me. I, of course, would end up having my (our) parents know and probably be disgusted with me too, but I don't really care. I only see them on the holidays anyway, not a bit loss. My only concern would be if knowledge of my sister and I made it's way to my job. I doubt they could fire me FOR that reason, but they would likely find another reason to let me go.\n\n\nSo I finished my workout and then came home. I didn't text her the next day, so I could gauge her response. Well, she didn't disappoint. That night she texted me asking if her video helped with me being so lonely (as I live alone and am not dating). I told her yes, that it helped me a few times. We then started talking about fitness and I then sent her a picture I had taken of my developing abs (yeah yeah, I know - it's douche-y, shut up). She then sent me a picture of her stomach. The difference was that in my picture I left on my workout shorts, and she was completely nude in hers. I then asked if her husband was happy with her body developments. She said he was, but that he didn't see her naked that often. She went on to describe that her sex life with her husband isn't great and it really hasn't been for several years. Really since she had my niece. We then got on the topic of my sex life, or lack thereof, since my divorce. It ended with us agreeing that it was too bad we didn't live closer.\n\n\nSo this conversation just made things worse for me. I still felt like I was thinking with my dick instead of my head. So I started considering, what if we went the other way. What if we got together?\n\n3. What if we were to get together, as a couple? So, this thought has danced in my head ever since I started dating my now-ex wife. What if my sister and I just moved in together and became a couple? Well, what about now? Well, now she would have to get a divorce and go through that process, not to mention sharing time with her daughter. Okay, it's not ideal, but it's doable. We could also use the divorce and her moving in with me as \"she wanted to be with family after the divorce\" to justify her residing with me. \n\nSo let's look at this situation, she moves in with me, we start having a typical relationship. Well, for her it works out because she has already had a child and now she is having the sex that she wants. But... what about me? I have not had a child yet. Though it has never been a huge priority for me, what if I decide that I want one? I know it is one of the reasons my ex wife and I split, but my view of kids has softened as I have gotten older. What if in... I dunno, 4-5 years, I want a kid? I can't have that with my sister, unless we want to risk having a child with severe health risks. SO, basically, it would mean me never having the option to reproduce, unless I decide to step out on my sister. Which brings me to the next issue:\n\n4. What if it doesn't work? My sister and I had sex when we were young, but it was always just fun and free. Then, as we got older, our sex became how we spent time together while one or the other of us was in a relationship with someone else. Even when married. But really, we've never had sex with the idea that we are \"in a relationship\". What if it doesn't work? What if we try and fail? Then we break up, okay - that's normal, but instead of losing a girlfriend, I may lose the familial relationship with my sister as well. Is that something worth risking? It's the same question as when you start having feelings for a good friend. Is it worth destroying the friendship if something goes wrong?\n\nWell, I don't have the answer.\n\nFor the last week we have continued talking and flirting, but we finally (last night - as I was going to bed). Started talking about, seeing each other, maybe having her come to visit me. Just her. We were talking about Halloween since we both used to love decorating and dressing up as kids, but have stopped since we are \"adults\". The idea has me, just being honest, excited and I have butterflies in my stomach thinking about it, but... I guess thinking about stuff ruins things. \n\n\nAnyway, thank you all for your thoughts and comments. I directed my sister to my last post and she read your comments. After that is when she started talking about coming to visit. Lastly, I told her all of this in an email already, so she knows about it and my thought process on the matter, and her response was \"you're thinking too much.\"\n",
