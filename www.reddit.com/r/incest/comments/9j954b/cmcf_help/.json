It doesnt have to be obviously, but this will give you the opportunity to open the discussions around sex/relationship stuff. \nLet her ask you questions, Im sure she has some in her mind that she doesnt feel comfortable talking about with even her girlfriends, much less a guy friend. If you give her this type of forum, where she feels safe talking to you about it, well, then it can lead in many different directions. And keep the family bond where it is, even make it stronger, as she will build a lifelong friend where she can discuss these matters with. \nAbove all, dont take advantage and dont abuse this trust. Keep it secret, keep everything private, and dont take chances, they could be disastrous. Make sure if anything ever does develop, that you plan, both of you, plan ahead. If you are going to carry on with anything, make sure every one is gone, make sure when anyone will be coming back and dont do anything in a public eye of your family or friends that can lead to suspicion.\n\nMy cousin and I did this many years ago, we have shared our thoughts throughout the years and still to this day remain close, the sexual stuff passed, it was fun while we did it, and we talk about it to this day when we get together, and how its shaped our thoughts through the years. \n\nGood luck  ",
