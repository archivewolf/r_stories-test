I wanted to post here to explain a little better how my daughter and I got into this situation. She knows I'm posting and approves of this version of events.\n\n*My ex-wife conceived our daughter through fertility treatments I didn't know about at a clinic we had used previously. We were already divorced, and I had recently moved away with my three sons to another town. It was only through a mutual friend that I found out she had given birth to a girl. At the time, I thought the child's father was her live in boyfriend. Fast forward 13 years to my daughter contacting me on Facebook to tell me I was her biological father. She always believed the aforementioned boyfriend was her father until she applied for a passport and saw her birth certificate for the first time. My ex had put my name on her birth certificate without telling my daughter the truth. After learning the truth, my daughter wanted to know more about me and found how to contact me through the same mutual friend. Ever since then, we've kept in touch through email, Facebook, Skype, etc. However, when my daughter went to college, she ended up going near where I work. She insisted we meet in person, and I finally gave into her requests earlier this year.*\n\nWe chose to meet one afternoon in a local cafe for coffee. We got there about the same time and had a moment of awkward hugging. She looked cute in a boho blouse and jeans. I had come straight from work, so I was wearing a white button down shirt and grey trousers. We were seated and proceeded to talk non-stop for two hours, which involved a lot of coffee and pastry. Nothing felt out of the ordinary. It was like meeting an old friend. We even made plans to go to a recital her friend was playing in, in a few weeks time. It started raining while we were in the cafe. Since she had taken the bus there, I offered to drive my daughter back to her off campus apartment, so she wouldn't get soaked waiting at the bus stop. She accepted, and we left shortly after that.\n\nI drove her back and asked if there was a bathroom on the ground floor I could use. I was dying for a pee from drinking so much coffee. I parked in her parking space, and we ran through the rain to enter the building. She showed me where the single stall bathroom in the lobby was. After I came back from relieving myself, we exchanged good-byes. I hugged my daughter and meant to kiss her on the cheek but kissed her on the lips by mistake. Everything changed in that moment. Maybe I subconsciously wanted to do it, but I now felt differently about her. I apologized, but she smiled and said it was okay. She felt the same way. My daughter had definitely kissed me back. \n\n\u201cIf you're not doing anything right now, why don't you come up to the apartment. You can see where I live,\u201d she said. I hesitated. Who knows what would happen in the privacy of her apartment. She sensed my hesitation. \u201cMy roommate shouldn't be home yet.\u201d I nodded and followed her to the stairwell. We climbed up to the fourth floor. I was quite nervous walking down the hall to her door. She let us in, and like she said, her roommate wasn't home yet. There was a note left for my daughter by the door saying her roommate would be back from her job early. We took off our shoes and hung our damp jackets on the coat tree. She gave me a little tour of the apartment, which ended in the kitchen.\n \n\u201cDo you want a beer?\u201d she asked. \n\n\u201cSure, why not,\u201d I said as I sat down on one of the uncomfortable plastic chairs. She reached in the fridge, pulled out two cans of premium beer and put them on the table. \u201cYou have good taste.\u201d \n\n\u201cMy roommate likes this. She buys it all the time,\u201d said my daughter as she sat down across the table from me. We cracked open the cans. While we drank and talked, I couldn't help but stare at my daughter's mouth. I wanted her to stop talking so I could lean across the table and kiss her. It was a persistent urge that would not go away no matter how much I tried to ignored it. \n\n\u201cDon't you think so?\u201d she said. I shrugged because I hadn't been listening. She didn't seem fazed. \u201cI guess at your age, people don't care how many apps can fit on a phone.\u201d \n\n\u201cMmm, I don't know about that,\u201d I said, finishing my beer. \n\n\u201cWant another one?\u201d she asked. I looked at the clock on the microwave. I still had plenty of time before I had to leave to beat rush hour traffic. \n\n\u201cSure, why not,\u201d I said. She got up and put two more beers on the table. I tried to drink this one a little slower. We talked about how awful the weather had been. She hadn't had a chance to go hiking this season. I complained about the terrible state of the roads around the college and how lucky she was that she didn't have to drive on them. We still didn't run out of things to say. The words just spilled out until she finished her second beer. \n\n\u201cExcuse me a moment,\u201d she said. My daughter got up from the kitchen table and went to use the toilet. I finished the rest of my beer and put all the cans in the recycling bin next to the trash can as I passed it going into the living room. I looked around at the nature photos on the wall and wondered if my daughter had taken them. My butt hurt from sitting on that chair, so I plopped down on their overstuffed sofa. I glanced at the clock beside the TV and figured I could stay another 20 minutes before I really had to leave to beat traffic. *She's taking a long time in the bathroom,*I thought after awhile. I almost got up to see if she was okay but heard the toilet flushing and the door open. My daughter looked in the kitchen first, then saw me on the sofa. She came over and sat on my lap. \n\n\u201cDid you miss me, Daddy?\u201d she asked and smiled. I didn't reply. I felt that irresistible urge to kiss her well-up inside me. I cupped her face with my hands. She put her hands on my shoulders and nodded, as if to acknowledge what was about to happen. My daughter leaned in, and our lips touched. I looked her in the eye as we pressed them firmly together. She closed her eyes and opened her mouth. Our tongues rubbed against each other's. She tasted like the beer we were just drinking. I closed my eyes and pulled her closer. We shared a slow sensual kiss that made my toes curl. I couldn't believe my daughter was kissing me like we were about to head into the bedroom. If this was how she kissed...This lasted a few minutes before she stopped to shifted her legs and straddle my lap. Her breasts pressed against my body. She rested her hands back on my shoulders, lacing her fingers behind my neck. My hands moved up her thighs and cupped her ass. We stared at each other in silence. Her desire was obvious. I was getting a semi.\n\n\u201cWe shouldn't be doing this,\u201d I said. Her eyes lowered. She made a noise in agreement. Her hands slid down my chest and sides, stopping at my waist. She rested her forehead against mine. We stayed like this until both of us were breathing normally again. That urge was still eating away at me. \n\n\u201cI want to,\u201d she said, \u201cI wasn't just peeing in the bathroom, I was masturbating.\u201d My heart jumped into my throat. She had a serious look on her face. I tried to remain calm. \u201cI'm so wet right now. I know you're my father, but I want to fuck you anyway.\u201d I nodded not knowing how to reply. \u201cWhen we first started chatting online, I didn't think anything of it. You were basically a stranger to me. But when we started Skyping this year, the longer we talked, the more I felt an attraction to you. If we ever met in person, I was hoping this would happen.\u201d I never occurred to me that this could happen. I didn't have any sexual thoughts about my daughter until the moment my lips touched hers. We brushed noses. She gave me a peck on the lips. \u201cPlease, Daddy,\u201d she whispered. She pressed her cheek against mine. I should have picked her up, put her back on her feet, and left before something else happened. Instead, I fell over the edge with her. We started kissing again. My body was burning. I wanted to take off her blouse and bra to suck on her tits. She held onto my waist and made fucking motions with her hips. My hands slipped down the back of her jeans to fondle her firm round ass. She unbuttoned my shirt and kissed my neck and chest. I was becoming completely hard. Her fingers started to unbuckle my belt. \n\n\u201cStop,\u201d I said, placing my hands over hers, \u201cI can't do that.\u201d The words left my mouth as she rubbed the hard on in my trousers. \n\n\u201cReally?\u201d She unzipped my fly and went to reach inside. I grabbed her wrist. \n\n\u201cDon't,\u201d I said. We stared at each other. She was dying to have sex with me right then and there. The rational part of my brain couldn't give into her even if my dick was ready to. \n\nThe sound of her roommate's key in the door brought us back to our senses. She stood up and straightened out her clothes. I zipped up my trousers and buttoned up my shirt as her roommate hung up her jacket on the coat tree and entered the living room. My daughter introduced us. I stood and shook her roommate's hand. There would have been an awkward pause if I hadn't blurted out, \u201cI really should be going.\u201d Her roommate looked surprised. \n\n\u201cYou've already gone out?\u201d she asked. \n\n\u201cYes, we had coffee at the cafe,\u201d said my daughter. \n\n\u201cOh, that's great. She's talked about meeting you for forever,\u201d said her roommate. We looked at each other and laughed in that uncomfortable way. I shook her roommate's hand again and told her it was nice to meet her. My daughter watched me while I put on my shoes and jacket. We stood in the entrance way not sure what to say. \n\n\u201cI'll call you?\u201d I asked. She smiled. \n\n\u201cJust text me when you get home, okay?\u201d \n\n\u201cRight.\u201d I leaned over and kissed her on the forehead. She looked disappointed. I opened the door and let myself out. She leaned out the doorway and watched me walk down the hallway. I turned and waved to her as I opened the stairwell door. She waved and went back inside her apartment. I walked down to stairs thinking about how hot kissing my daughter had been. My hard on came roaring back, and I went into the bathroom in the lobby to deal with it. If her roommate hadn't come home, my daughter probably would have been riding my dick the very first time we met. The thought of sex with her thrilled and terrified me at the same time. I stroked myself, reliving that moment of passion with her, until I came in the toilet. I stood there a moment not sure what to do. As my dick softened, I took a few deep breaths and flushed the toilet. I straighten myself out and zipped up my fly. I washed my hands and splashed cold water on my face, wondering what was going to happen now. This experience was still so raw. I dried my hands and face and sighed. I went back out to the lobby. There was more than enough time to think about this on my long drive home. \n\nI pulled up the hood of my jacket and stepped out into the rain.\n\nEdited for formatting.",

There would have been an awkward pause if I hadn&amp;#39;t blurted out, \u201cI really should be going.\u201d Her roommate looked surprised. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cYou&amp;#39;ve already gone out?\u201d she asked. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cYes, we had coffee at the cafe,\u201d said my daughter. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cOh, that&amp;#39;s great. She&amp;#39;s talked about meeting you for forever,\u201d said her roommate. We looked at each other and laughed in that uncomfortable way. I shook her roommate&amp;#39;s hand again and told her it was nice to meet her. My daughter watched me while I put on my shoes and jacket. We stood in the entrance way not sure what to say. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI&amp;#39;ll call you?\u201d I asked. She smiled. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cJust text me when you get home, okay?\u201d &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cRight.\u201d I leaned over and kissed her on the forehead. She looked disappointed. I opened the door and let myself out. She leaned out the doorway and watched me walk down the hallway. I turned and waved to her as I opened the stairwell door. She waved and went back inside her apartment. I walked down to stairs thinking about how hot kissing my daughter had been. My hard on came roaring back, and I went into the bathroom in the lobby to deal with it. If her roommate hadn&amp;#39;t come home, my daughter probably would have been riding my dick the very first time we met. The thought of sex with her thrilled and terrified me at the same time. I stroked myself, reliving that moment of passion with her, until I came in the toilet. I stood there a moment not sure what to do. As my dick softened, I took a few deep breaths and flushed the toilet. I straighten myself out and zipped up my fly. I washed my hands and splashed cold water on my face, wondering what was going to happen now. This experience was still so raw. I dried my hands and face and sighed. I went back out to the lobby. There was more than enough time to think about this on my long drive home. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I pulled up the hood of my jacket and stepped out into the rain.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edited for formatting.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
