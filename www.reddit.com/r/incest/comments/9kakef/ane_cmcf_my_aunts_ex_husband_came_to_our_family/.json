This town had many cabins, stores, hotels, restaurants, and other things too. For weeks my family had planned this trip, and my aunt Mariela and cousin Diana were excited since this meant that we could sneak off and have sex in the forest, which was something that we have always wanted to do. Since my family is fucking huge, and I mean like, 30 people huge, it would take a while for everyone to arrive. Not everyone would see each other since we would only be there for 3-4 days.\n\nJust as a reminder, my aunt was married to a guy who was completely despicable to say the least. Almost all of my family absolutely loved him, though. He would treat those who liked him in my family with so much respect and he would act like the most charismatic person you\u2019ve ever met, but when he would talk to the few who hated his guts,like me, it was like a switch would turn off in his head and he would become the most toxic bully you could ever have the pleasure of meeting. He would constantly make snide remarks, make fun of your appearance, act like the biggest wannabe alpha around you, and try to be better at everything than you. Now, I\u2019m not the most muscular guy. I\u2019m fact, I\u2019m actually pretty thin and tall, around 6 feet. For almost a year I\u2019ve been going to the gym and I have seen progress, but this jackass always tried to one-up me. One time, I went to a pool party that my family was hosting in the backyard,  and around that time, I was already having sex with my aunt while she was still with her ex husband. I began to take my shirt off as I was about to jump in, and this guy begins to laugh at the way my body was shaped. He began to make rude comments like \u201cYou look really starved, want a burger,\u201d \u201cHow can you pull chicks with a body like that, you need to look a bit bigger to get lucky,\u201d \u201cI guess your not as lucky.\u201d The entire time I was just laughing at the fact that my aunt cheated on him with me frequently  and he had no idea. \n\nAnyways, after the whole video thing happened with us, my aunt never talked to him again. We thought he was out of our lives and now I could continue my relationship with her without fearing that I would get caught by him. However, since my family loved him so much, they invited him knowing that my aunt hates him. He managed to convince most of them, except the ones who dislike him, that my aunt was the one who cheated on him, which is bullshit. By the time we began to drive up to the mountains, Diana called while she sat with my family at a restaurant waiting for the rest of us to arrive. As I put her on speaker, she said that \u201cI\u2019m sitting next to Juan at the restaurant and he keeps eyeing my thighs and talking about how excited he is to catch up with you.\u201d My aunt made a \u201cWhat the fuck\u201d face and began to rant about how the trip was ruined and how he was going to do something. As we drove up even more, my other family members who hated Juan began to call her and ask why he was invited. My aunt denied any involvement and said that she is going to stay away from them. I called Diana and said that she should stay away from Juan, because this dude is really unpredictable. She agreed and said that he was creepy. \n\nOnce we arrived at the restaurant, my family greeted my aunt and I and Juan also greeted her while completely ignoring me. My aunt gave him the weakest hug I\u2019ve ever seen. She didn\u2019t even touch him, she just hovered her arms around him as he hugged her. And made this awkward face as she rolled her eyes. Juan then bumps into me and doesn\u2019t even apologize. We all sit down and Juan tries to find a seat next to her, but Diana and I cockblock him as he tries to get a chair next to her. He gives me the \u201cdeath glare\u201d as he finds another chair that is farther away from my aunt but still close. The entire night he tries to talk to my aunt but she ignored him. Hilarious. \n\nThe next day, my family spread out and decided that different groups of us would go to find different things to do. Some of us went hiking, others went shopping, others rented boats and went on the lake, and others just did random shit. My aunt and cousin decided that the three of us would hike and have sex in a secluded place. As the three of us hiked, my aunt let me and Diana know that Juan tried to confront her the night before as she made her way to her hotel room about the video that she sent of \u201csome guy fucking her in the ass,\u201d as he put it. My aunt just walked away as my other aunt, who also dislikes him, tried to make him back off. He began to get aggressive and tried to grab my aunt, but the employees intervened. He began to shout that he missed her and that he loves her, and my aunt just walked away as she contemplated what she saw in him before. \n\nAs the three of us made our way to a secluded spot, we deviated from the path as we looked for a private place to go to. We arrived at this secluded spot with benches and a bunch of trees and bushes that would cover us. As my aunt and I sat down, Diana leaned on a tree and kept a look out as she watched my aunt begin to give me a blowjob. I held her ponytail as her head bobbed up and down. She then pulled down her leggings and panties midway through her thighs as she sat on my dick and began to ride me. Her warm hole made it so much better since it was fucking cold up there. We continued until she came and then switched places with Diana. Diana also began to give me a blowjob, and she bent over on the bench and asked me to fuck her. I obliged and grabbed her by the hips as I pounded her ass. We were having a good time as both of them finished me off by taking turns giving me head. I finally came as my aunt jerked me off and Diana and I made out. The three of us sat next to each other as I put my arms around the two of them. We suddenly heard noises coming from far away, and we immediately pulled up our clothes and dressed up to see who it was. \n\nIt was my two uncles, one aunt, and Juan, walking up to our spot laughing about something. Juan immediately said \u201cMariela, what a surprise to find you here!\u201d The three of us immediately walked off as Juan began to follow us and tried talking to Mariela. My aunt wasn\u2019t having it, and she yelled at Juan to \u201cback the fuck up before I get a restraining order against you.\u201d Juan didn\u2019t stop perusing her. He followed us the whole way down the trail yelling about how he missed my aunt and wants her back and that he\u2019s sorry about everything. My aunt was about to explode, but I gently placed my arm around her and told her that we would get the police involved if he continued to follow us. We finally made our way down and Juan gave up his attempts. My aunt was so fucking red it was scary, but Diana and I calmed her down as we walked to my room for another round of sex. \n\nLater that night, I was going to meet up with my cousins to go on their boat on the lake. As I walked there, Juan came up from behind me and began to yell at me about how it was my fault that Mariela hated him. He smelled like beer and cologne, so I knew he was probably drunk. He looked like he was about to pass out. He told me that she sent him a video of her having sex with some guy after they divorced, and that he didn\u2019t do anything other than try to get her attention by sending her a video of him sleeping with one of her friends first. I said I know, she told me about it, and that she didn\u2019t date losers like him, so he should give up. Juan then grabbed me and began to yell that he knew that I liked my aunt, and that he knew that we were having sex. I got so fucking mad that lost control. I grabbed him by the shirt and told him \u201cYeah, I fucked Mariela and she loved it as she lied to your fucking face. She chose me instead of you.\u201d I pushed him off as he fell and tried to regain his balance. He then yelled as I walked off that he would fuck me up if he ever saw us together. I regretted what I had said, but I knew that he wouldn\u2019t remember because he was really, really, really drunk. \n\nWe didn\u2019t see Juan the next day, and we assumed that he had left after he failed to get my aunt back. However, I found out that on our last day there, as my aunt was packing up in her hotel room, Juan arrives there as she is alone, sober. He comes in the room as she tells him to back off. Juan closes the door and starts trying to kiss my aunt and once she rejects him, he yells at her that he knows that my aunt and I are together, but my aunt just denied it. He tried to grab her but she kicked him hard in the balls. He falls to the floor and she gets help from the neighbors in the other rooms. \n\nMy family found out about what Juan tried to do, and my aunt is currently getting a restraining order against him. He destroyed his credibility, so my family won\u2019t find out about my aunt and I since they know how desperate he is. Now that he is out of the picture, I\u2019m not worried since he has no proof at all, and the old video doesn\u2019t show anything that would point to me being my aunt\u2019s \u201cother guy.\u201d ",
