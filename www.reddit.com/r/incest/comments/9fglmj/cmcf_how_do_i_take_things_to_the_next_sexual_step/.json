Things got more intense when she moved into my house and ended up being in the room down the hall from me. As time went along my attraction got stronger. At one point she would always leave her room unlocked and I would sneak in and jerk off to her panties. Then the obsession faded as I started having sexual relationships with women who weren't related to me lol but as of recent these physical attractions have come back and with a force. Now this is where I need help. This time around the feeling doesn't seem to be one sided. As the feelings got stronger I got more aggressive. I got to a point where I basically felt it would be better If she know I was into her and she thinks I'm a creep than to live with these physical attractions alone. So I started to do things to let it be known I was sexual. When it was just Me and her in the house I would invite my girlfriend over and have sex very loudly, my girlfriend knows of my obsession and is jealous but the inner slut in her can't help but go along with it and moaning loudly so she could hear. I guess in a way my girlfriend does it to spite my cousin in a way. Well one day I decided I wasn't going to hide it anymore and took things even further. Since that day whenever my cousin is around &amp; its just us I don't hide my raging boner. She walks around the house with no panties and her butt crack out every day and it turns me on all the way INSTANTLY. 10 seconds full boner. So lately I haven't been hiding my boner and I noticed she's noticed it more than ten times and one time I caught her even looking at it. And it's fully out there not hidden at all and I know she sees it every time. But she has yet to complain and no one has said anything to me so apart of me feels she likes it. To get even deeper she even talks to me more often now. About random things and I can tell it's to simply spark a convo. But she still holds back and gives me mixed signals. I want to upgrade my advances and start to make me staring at her butt crack and ass very obvious. Should I? Any advice ? And how can I get her to give me a solid yes or no sign ? Or how could I get her to throw me a bone",
