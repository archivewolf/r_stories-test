She's also a white supremacist, and had a major problem with me dating someone who wasn't white. I cut contact with her immediately.\n\nI though about potentially trying to repair things, but went through a messy breakup and a ton of other stressful things and decided against it. About two weeks ago, I noticed that several of my friends suddenly stopped speaking to me. A few days after that, one of my friends confronted me about going to white supremacist gathering.\n\nI denied it and managed to get a picture, which showed my sister there. My sister and I look extremely similar, and even our parents sometimes mix us up, so I thought it was just an honest mistake. I convinced my friend that it wasn't me and tried to put out as much in my defense as possible.\n\nToday, I got an email from my sister under a new address. She basically said that she still had feelings for me and that she would always be willing to accept the love of her \"dear brother\", unlike my friends. The fact that she knew about my friends got me suspicious, and I managed to find a tumblr from her email.\n\nIt had just a few posts calling me out as a white supremacist, with the same picture my friend sent me. I'm straight up at a loss as to what to do at this point. I can stop her from contacting me, but I can't stop her from turning my friends against me or getting me fired. I also have a first date with a girl I'm really interested in tomorrow, and I don't know how to say \"my sister is an obsessed nazi who's trying to isolate me by making everything think I share her views\" in a way that's acceptable on a first date. If anyone has any advice or even just sympathy, I'd love to hear it.",
