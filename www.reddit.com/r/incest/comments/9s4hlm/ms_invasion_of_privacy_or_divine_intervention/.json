I am not sure how long this will last and if it's permanent but we needed to do so to avoid becoming completely exposed. About a week after meeting my mom at the hotel, we were in the basement (our sanctuary). It was close to midnight. We didn't think we'd be disturbed. We were both on the bed as mom was giving me a blow job. I was on my knees and mom was kind of laying propped up on some pillows. Now, we were really into this..she was moaning and I was kind of being vocal as well.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUsually we lock the basement door before going in, but like I said, we REALLY didn't expect to be disturbed. Looking back, we'd gotten careless with our sessions and almost been caught by dad previously, so we should have been more careful. \n\nAs I was about to cum, I told my mom to stop so I could cum on her chest. I didn't want her to swallow because my diet the past couple days has been complete shit and I knew I wouldn't taste good to her. So, I pulled my cock out of her mouth and aimed it at her chest, came as I usually did, then mom grabbed my cock and started rubbing me all over her face. As she was doing so, she turned her head to the left a little more than usual and out of the corner of her eye she saw my sister just staring at us. She immediately jumped up and grabbed her clothes to cover herself. When I saw this, my heart instantly dropped. I hadn't yet turned to see who had caught us, but my fear was that it was my dad, so I was VERY hesitant to turn.  \n\n\nBefore I even turned, my mom started speaking, ***\"\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_(sister's name), it's not what you think\"***. When I heard it was one of my sister's I was relieved. As I began to turn around, my sister spoke up, ***\"Mom, you're sucking \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_'s (my name) cock!! What is wrong with you two!!?\"***. At this point, I turned around completely. As I did, I saw my sister's eyes dart down to my wilting cock. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, to this day, I don't know why I said it, but I've thought about this every day since then. Noticing where my sister's eyes were, my stupid ass decided to say ***\"It's not even hard yet\"***, in a mischievous way. I don't know what I was thinking, maybe I thought this would play out like a porno. I mean this whole experience had been surreal, I didn't know the meaning of the word impossible anymore. My mom was also shocked by my words because she looked at me and said ***\"\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ shut up! Now is NOT the time!\".***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis whole time, my sister hadn't moved from where she was standing. She just sort of stood there in shock, taking it all in. My mom on the other hand began getting quickly dressed and I followed suit. When she was dressed, she got up and walked over to my sister, whispered something to her and then they began leaving the basement. Before leaving, my mom looked at me and told me to go to my room. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was in my room for maybe an hour and a half before my mom messaged me on SnapChat (I assume, so she wouldn't have a trail of messages), ***\"It's all good. I told her it was a one time thing and it's not gonna happen again. We need to stop.\"***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nObviously I felt defeated. Feelings of guilt started coming back and I began to really freak out that my sister would say something. It's almost been 2 weeks since then, and my sister still hasn't said a word to me. My dad is still acting the same, so I don't think he knows anything, but like I said, my sister hasn't said anything to me, and now my other sister is also starting to limit her conversations with me, so I feel like my sister said something to her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo that's the reason I haven't posted since then. I've actually been avoiding reddit altogether. I've been trying to keep busy with other things so that I can forget about what happened with my sister catching us, but it's extremely hard to go back to jacking off after having someone help you for the past few months. My mom and I haven't talked much about it either. My mom goes to bed with my dad now, and so I haven't really had a chance to talk. I think she knows if she stays after, things may escalate, so she's saving herself from herself, I guess. For now, I've just been trying to relive my memories by using the pics and vids that I have of my mom and I, but like I said, it's really not the same.",

Looking back at my comments to these stories, I've not shown myself to ever be on the OP's side, mostly because I never approved of his behavior.  He always seemed to be more concerned about his own gratification than his mother's desire.  So I can't feel sad for him.  Not at all.  He ruined his relationship with his mother and sisters.  Just wait until his father finds out the truth.  At least as vicious as I am, I'm not just attacking him.  I'm offering perspective on how he can improve his life.  Encouraging him to use this as a learning opportunity going forward, to realize that sex can't be the priority in his life.  Relationships and respect supersede sex.  Especially family, in this case.  His mom and his sister are not just sexual objects to please him.  They are emotional beings, and the behavior of the OP is not considerate to that.",

Looking back at my comments to these stories, I&amp;#39;ve not shown myself to ever be on the OP&amp;#39;s side, mostly because I never approved of his behavior.  He always seemed to be more concerned about his own gratification than his mother&amp;#39;s desire.  So I can&amp;#39;t feel sad for him.  Not at all.  He ruined his relationship with his mother and sisters.  Just wait until his father finds out the truth.  At least as vicious as I am, I&amp;#39;m not just attacking him.  I&amp;#39;m offering perspective on how he can improve his life.  Encouraging him to use this as a learning opportunity going forward, to realize that sex can&amp;#39;t be the priority in his life.  Relationships and respect supersede sex.  Especially family, in this case.  His mom and his sister are not just sexual objects to please him.  They are emotional beings, and the behavior of the OP is not considerate to that.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

Like sending a sexual text to your mom while your dad is sitting with her.  Or inviting your mom downstairs to talk after she was angry with you for that text, only to ask for another handjob instead of apologizing as she seemed to believe you would.  Or catfishing your dad so that you can have an excuse to have sex with his wife.  Or sending a dick pic with the caption about your mom wanting it inside her when she refused to even touch you.  To me, you seem to have this arrogance that leads to selfish actions.  You seem proud of your penis to the point that you try to use it to exert dominance.  And with that pride, you take greater and greater risks.  That line your mom said in a previous update, about loving your penis so much and that being why she couldn\u2019t resist it: I don\u2019t know if you are so convinced of the power you have over women because of it that you think you can have your way, but it really reads like that is the case.  I do feel, though, that it does rule your thoughts and actions.\n\nThat line to your sister was a further demonstration of this complex you seem to have, and it should hopefully be used to maybe evaluate your thought process.  You make a pass on your sister when she catches you with her mom.  That was a careless error and you not only put yourself at risk by being caught, but you jeopardized your relationship with your sisters. Not every girl wants your dick, and that kind of offense can really linger.  That may have been more harmful than witnessing you and your mom caught in the act.  Of course, that could be scarring, but that was not directly aimed at her like your remark was.  Besides that, it was an act of disrespect toward your mom, the woman with whom you have been sexually involved, to switch to trying to seduce a different woman so soon after being with her.  Just think how any woman could take that.  I think the repercussions of your actions could be a good opportunity for you to consider what needs to change in how you behave.  Because nothing will be the same now.",

That's your FAMILY, this could have destroyed your entire family and the only thing your worried about is a BJ shortage?!?! Seriously man, WTF?!?  \n\n\nGo get a girlfriend or better yet a hooker, at least then they'll know upfront you don't give a shit about them. You seriously need to evaluate your actions and motives here.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",
