Apologies for mobile formatting, never made a post before etc.\n\nI am in my 20s and this all started and finished years ago, so I won't be adding any details because underage at the time. I was young, confused and, uncertain, I suppose, anyway, I met my half brother for the first time, we'll call him Arthur, and we got on very well as siblings, like two peas in a pod! Growing up we never knew the other existed but we found we were so similar in personality.\n\nArthur's mother only had boys and mine only had girls, so we didn't *really* know how to be brother and sister. Nowadays we get along quite well as siblings (I am a naturally cuddly person though) but back then, it was a learning curve.\n\nNow as I said, I was young and Confused, he was older than me by 2 to 4 years and we were both hormonal, as you can expect, things happened.during this time we dated other people, we weren't emotionally together, just *physically* (I'm sure you get what I mean) I don't remember all the details, I think we had a fight or something (I had anger issues back then that I have since worked on) and it all stopped.\n\nfor a while afterwards I was ashamed that it had happened, after all he was my brother, a blood relative. now, I just accept that it happened and have moved on from it. I have, at times (when I'm lonely) thought about him in that way, but I couldn't. Not because the thought shames or disgusts me, it is what it is, but I just, don't wish to, if that makes sense?\n\nI still have an incest fetish, I admit that, but now it's more something I wish to RP with my SO, than actually DO. As in \"oh yes, *spank* me daddy, I'm your little *slut* (so hot~)\" My SO is in his 30s, let's call him Hans, 10 + years difference, he's a very sweet man and so supportive, even being in a separate country.\n\nNow at this point, you're probably wondering 'she seems to have it all worked out what advice was she talking about at the beginning?' well, I'll tell you. Recently some unfortunate events have happened and my brother's mother has passed away (may her soul rest in peace) and while he's grieving his SO has, decided (for lack of a better word) that during this time they shouldn't have sex.\n\nWe were discussing this and, again for lack of a better word, reminiscing about old times. at this point I must say for context, we have a very open brother and sister relationship because of our past, and as such, we discuss all kinds of subjects. now, it was at this point he asked if I'd like to have a little session of meaningless sex, but I declined, I said I was happy with what I had with Hans, and for the record I still agree.\n\nI know he has anxiety and depression and is struggling but I really like his SO and they are good for each other, but he has cheated in the past, and I don't want him to repeat that, which I fear he will especially after asking if I would. Should I talk to him about it, or her, or both? Or let him self destruct? (A notion which pains me to even suggest)\n\nI love my brother but no longer in that way, but I do not want to see him hurt or in pain. How can I help him?
