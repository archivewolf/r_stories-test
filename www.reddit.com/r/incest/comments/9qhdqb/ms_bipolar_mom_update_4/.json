She seemed like she just drank 15 red bulls or something, jumpy and jittery. I know from PMing a dude here who used to bang a bipolar chick and was giving me tips she probably was having some kind of manic episode.\n\nShe asked what I was doing and if I wanted to hangout. I was like almost asleep so I said I asked what was up. She climbed on top of me in my bed and grabbed my face and just started kissing me. She said she was so horny she felt like cutting her skin off. She asked if I wanted to fuck. I said yes. She said we'd have to keep it secret, not a fucking word to her boyfriend.\n\nI'm like yeah I got it. I don't want to get my ass beaten. \n\nSo she took her nightshirt off and we made out and she reached in between us and awkwardly jerked my cock off. She kept stopping to say \"is this wrong?\" And I was like \"no.\" Then finally she stopped again. The dude giving me tips with bipolar chicks said they like it rough so I just grabbed the back of her head and pulled her back in for a kiss and that really seemed to get her going.\n\nAfter a bit she slipped my cock inside her, there was some initial fumbling around and then shr started riding me. She was wet. Like super wet, super slick. She just rocked her hips up and down like crazy on my dick. I squeezed her big tits together and sucked on her nipples, she just like growled \"bite them, BITE THEM\" so fuck, gotta listen to your mom so I just bit down hard and she moaned and her pussy pulsed on my dick.\n\nShe rode me faster and faster and bam, I came. Shot a big load inside her. She slowed riding as my dick got softer and eventually flopped out. She climbed off and got her nightshirt back on. I asked if she came and she said no, but she was close though. I asked if she wanted me to finger her and she said no. She told me not to tell anybody and left. \n\nSo it happened but I wish she had come too. Honestly I get hard so quickly I wish she had let me gone again. This morning I didn't see her. I texted her to see if she's ok and she said yes, we'll talk later.",

I\u2019ve had mania, and I know the effect it has on brain chemistry and sexual drive.  You apparently know just enough to use advice of how to take advantage of her while manic.  You have shown yourself to be more interested in your own needs than hers.  Instead of trying to help her through the memories of her father\u2019s abuse, you tried to manipulate her into getting what you wanted.  You think I know nothing about you?  Well I read your account on here, and I know enough.  Taking care of herself?  It\u2019s not about that.  It\u2019s about respecting her wishes while she is stable when she is manic, because she is not in her right mind when influenced by mania.\n\nWorry about yourself?  No, maybe consider how this could affect her.  Maybe consider how she will feel when she comes down from this.  And I never said to feel sorry for her.  I said not to take advantage of her.  Two different things.  You don\u2019t get it.  You exploited her weakness.  She may not have been in control of her faculties, but YOU WERE.  You can say \u201cNo mom, you are not thinking clearly.  I will wait until you are stable and if you still want to do it, then we can have sex.\u201d  Instead, you got what you wanted from her hyper-sexuality.\n\nI don\u2019t know shit about you?  What a bullshit excuse for your behavior.  I know Bipolar Disorder and you relied on someone online to get information on how to use it for your benefit.  I\u2019m offering perspective on how it affects the brain.  And warning you that this could come back to haunt her.\n\nOne final thing: looking out for yourself?  So sexually exploiting a mentally ill woman is benefiting yourself.  Maybe you have some imbalance in your brain too, cause that is fucked up.",

I\u2019ve had mania, and I know the effect it has on brain chemistry and sexual drive.  You apparently know just enough to use advice of how to take advantage of her while manic.  You have shown yourself to be more interested in your own needs than hers.  Instead of trying to help her through the memories of her father\u2019s abuse, you tried to manipulate her into getting what you wanted.  You think I know nothing about you?  Well I read your account on here, and I know enough.  Taking care of herself?  It\u2019s not about that.  It\u2019s about respecting her wishes while she is stable when she is manic, because she is not in her right mind when influenced by mania.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Worry about yourself?  No, maybe consider how this could affect her.  Maybe consider how she will feel when she comes down from this.  And I never said to feel sorry for her.  I said not to take advantage of her.  Two different things.  You don\u2019t get it.  You exploited her weakness.  She may not have been in control of her faculties, but YOU WERE.  You can say \u201cNo mom, you are not thinking clearly.  I will wait until you are stable and if you still want to do it, then we can have sex.\u201d  Instead, you got what you wanted from her hyper-sexuality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don\u2019t know shit about you?  What a bullshit excuse for your behavior.  I know Bipolar Disorder and you relied on someone online to get information on how to use it for your benefit.  I\u2019m offering perspective on how it affects the brain.  And warning you that this could come back to haunt her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One final thing: looking out for yourself?  So sexually exploiting a mentally ill woman is benefiting yourself.  Maybe you have some imbalance in your brain too, cause that is fucked up.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
