(Guess I was just stupid before, lol...)\n\nWell, like I said before, my brother/\"potential sister\" officially moved in on Friday night. There's not a whole lot to say about that, we went out to dinner after we got him situated in his new room and the rest of the night was spent quietly at home. Saturday was a little different... Me and my boyfriend specifically left our schedules empty, just to spend time with my brother and help him feel welcome, and so we could go out and do anything he wanted/needed to do. But he had no plans or ideas so we stayed home apart from a quick shopping trip, and it got... awkward. I really wanted to relax and \"go into pet mode\", I knew what my brother said about it not being a big deal and he wouldn't mind, but I just couldn't \"do it\", and I got pretty anxious... \n\nBut my boyfriend kind of got the ball rolling and basically saved the day, by accident. He just threw out a few ideas for something we could do, one of them was going to the pool, and we decided to do that. And I had the privilege of being able to help my \"brother\" (it'll be weird calling him my brother from here on out, lol...) pick out a more feminine swim suit to wear publicly for the first time. We changed together, which was sort of a \"Right, we can still do this, it's still not weird\" moment, and I got him situated in a tankini sort of thing with a skirt (The idea was to not show too much of his figure, but he really doesn't have to worry about that... He's not on hormones but he says he has a very focused diet and exercise routine to get the figure he's looking for... And it's working, I might have to do whatever he's doing, lol...).\n\nThe pool was fun, not very crowded which was good for my brother, he started to get a little stressed on the way there. Back at our home, I went to shower off the chlorine, and my \"brother\" just waltzed on into the bathroom and told me not to turn the water off so he can jump right in when I get out. Now, this happened all the time back when we lived together before, I was happy but a little shocked that he just jumped right back into our old groove, but I think that's a good thing. Passing by him fully nude was... different (Like I said before, I haven't let him see me bottomless for a while, I specifically avoided it when we got into our swimsuits). But it wasn't a big problem or anything. And while he was showering and before I could even put on anything but a towel, I kind of let myself go and got a little \"pet-ish\" with my boyfriend... just some snuggling, head scratching and purring on the couch... I was already too far into the zone to stop when my brother finished showering, he came and sat on the couch with us and got his first taste of me as a pet... The towel stayed on though, maybe next time I'll make that jump, lol...\n\nWell, that's our first night and full day with my brother living with us, hope it isn't terribly boring, I just felt like I needed to tell someone about it. I guess we'll wait and see what the rest of the day has in store, and the rest of my brother's time in my home I guess, hah...",
