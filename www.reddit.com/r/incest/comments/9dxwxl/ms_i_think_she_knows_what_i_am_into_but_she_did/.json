It has been almost 20 years that I have been thinking of us being together.\n\n2 years ago, I built up my courage and made my move but it was a major defeat. I told her directly, out of blue, that I wanted sexual intercourse with her.\n\nI wish I followed the advices that were written her, like showing myself a respectful and caring son or addressing myself a good lover instead of a well-behaved son.\n\nAfter I got knee-jerk reaction from her I tried to quit those feelings and but following to a couple of unsuccessful attempts to the other girls around me, these old feelings resurfaced.\n\nWhen I wrote the details of my unsuccessful attempts in this subreddit, many followers of this topic pointed out the fact that she had no intention of us having sex. In the beginning I tried to follow their words about not following my desire but it was difficult to dissolve an obsession that lasts 20 years.\n\nI have started to read every topic that was highlighted with MS tag. I put some of it in favourite list. \n\nReading those texts made me feel normal. Realising the fact that there are lots of people who are having the similar desires like I do, made me happy.\n\nFast forwarding to the incident that happened this evening; \n\nWhen I came home from work my mom was in my condo (we have been living in separate houses for almost 10 years). We made some regular conversations like the situation of my work and so on. While we were talking I realized that mom was using my computer. I saw that she chose to open the very same browser that I read this subreddit. The favorite pages are in a folder called \u2013 other bookmarks- and it is placed the top of the bookmarks bar. I am pretty sure that she did this in purpose trying to show me that she was aware of what I was reading. Normally She use my computer to watch Netflix shows but she does that with a different browser. \n\nAt first, I was so afraid about being discovered but when I approached where she was sitting, she closed that browser quickly.\n\nIs she giving me a signal or message about my secret urges? Why did not she say anything even if she read those pages? Is she waiting me for bringing up the subject to the table?\n\nI did not receive any positive messages from her side. When I try to sit down closely in order to touch her body, she get up from the couch quickly or she change her sitting position in order to keep the distance between us.\n\nI know this is a false hope but dreaming of us in the same bed gives me the upmost pleasure.
