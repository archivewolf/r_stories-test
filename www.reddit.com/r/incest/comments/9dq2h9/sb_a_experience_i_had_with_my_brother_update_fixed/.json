The drive took about 40 minutes and we didn't talk that much except he was constantly glancing at me which really started to irritate me and ask if it was about yesterday and he replied and he replied defensive way \"so what if I'm thinking about yesterday\" I apologized and said \"you gave me a competition and I wasn't just going to agree with you\". that didn't make him more aggressive but definitely calmed the air I used the opportunity to catch him by surprise and said \"if it will make it less awkward it can just take off my top again\" and all he could do was just sit in a dead stare at the light I used the opportunity to quickly take my top and bra off. And he was practically shaking I have never seen him so submissive with moments left until we would get home I turned to him used my arms and pushed my breasts together and told him \"hopefully I have cleared things up from yesterday\". But all he was doing was looking at the road once we pulled up to the house I asked the question before we had to go inside \"do you want to touch one\" now I was freaking out in my head but I stuck with it. and without even a moment to think he wrapped one arm around my back and his other one put right on my left boob and started to squeeze I was locked in and so turned on he moved it around a bit let it go and said let's just go inside I'm done. my biggest question at the time was what did I do wrong and why is he such an emotionless bastard he is either angry or nothing but I kind of like that about him I put on my top and went inside.\n\nthank you to anybody who is reading all comments are appreciated",
