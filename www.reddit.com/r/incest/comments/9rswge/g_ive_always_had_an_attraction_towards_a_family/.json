My grandmother has always lived with us but the way our house is built, there\u2019s the main house, then there\u2019s a little cabin like house attached to it. This has a kitchen, living room, bedroom. So if grandma wants her privacy, she has her own place to go.\n\nMy grand father died a few years ago, and I don\u2019t know. I guess in a way I\u2019ve always had this crush on my grandmother since before I can remember. There was just something about her that was so loving and mature at the same time. She\u2019s always been beautiful, looks much younger than her age. This is kind of embarrassing but I\u2019ve had dreams where she and I were having sex.\n\nMy grandmother and I were always close but I do remember a year ago when I was eighteen, I had come home from work and she was in the kitchen. She gave me a usual hug and I felt this strong urge to kiss her neck. So I kissed her neck. She just smiled and didn\u2019t say anything, she just continued making dinner.  \n\nI try to spend a lot of time with her but lately, those feelings that I\u2019ve tried to push to the back of my mind are coming back and I\u2019m having trouble ignoring them when I\u2019m around her.\n\nSo I\u2019ve decided I want to test the waters and make a move. Do you have any advice?",
