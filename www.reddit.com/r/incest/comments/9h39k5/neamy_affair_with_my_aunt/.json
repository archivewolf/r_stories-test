She's 48yo about 5'4 pale white porcelain skin, long dark hair, normal/slim build with wide hips. \nIt all started when we were on a family trip to india, we had rented a big apartment in Goa and it was me and my parents and my two aunts and their husbands and kids.  \n\nOn this day i was alone looking for sunglasses to buy since i had given my own to my dad. This is when I saw my aunt and her husband walking down the street with two Indians following them and harassing my aunt. Her husband was this gutless character that supposedly had a black belt in kungfu, whatever that means. I immediately jumped in and confronted the Indians and told them to stop following my Aunt.  I'm a pretty big guy about 6'1 260lbs so as i approached one of them took off and the other one started apologizing. Afterwards my aunt thanked me and her husband said he was about to fight them if i hadn't stepped in.\n\n\nThe whole family mets for lunch and I noticed my aunt decided to sit next to me instead of her husband. As we were eating my aunt whispered in my ear how thankful she was for me defending her and that her husband has never defended her ever. I told her it was ok and I didn't really do anything. She was wearing this white summer dress and under the table she had her beautiful pale white legs crossed and they were directed towards me, her legs was touching mine. I was soo tempted to put my hand on her smooth thigh but i stopped myself.\n\n\nThe next day they all wanted to go and see the non tourist areas of Goa I had no interest in doing so and my aunt had a migraine so we both stayed home. She cooked me breakfast and she said her migraine was clearing up, I suggested we go to the beach cause it was cloudy that day and my aunt hates being in the sun. \nOn the beach she opened up to me about her husband and that this kind of thing has happened in the past and that he hasn't done anything. I told her not to be so hard on her husband and that she is gorgeous which is why men follow her. she laughed and said that she wasn't that beautiful, I told her she was and she blushed a bit.\nBack at the apartment I went into the shower while she was preparing lunch. After lunch in the kitchen she hugged me and said I was a really good boy and then she corrected herself a good man, (im 20). I kissed her cheek and then her lips she looked shocked i kissed her more and she pushed me off and ran into her bedroom. i followed her and told her to open the door. she said if she opened the door we will do something we both will regret. In pure animal mode i busted the lock door open and i grabbed her kissed her and she kissed me back. I pushed her down on the bed and pulled her black skirt off and her panties. Her face was completely blushed only wearing her white t-shirt i took my pants off, opened her legs and mounted her. After I was done she grabs her panties off the floor and runs into the bathroom.\n\n\nI started having feelings of guilt, had I ruined our relationship? These thoughts were running in me head as she was in the bathroom cleaning up. I thought she will now come out of the bathroom and start yelling at me for what I did. She comes out of the bathroom wearing just her tshirt and panties and approaches me steps up on her pretty little toes puts her arms around me and kisses me and says its ok, and kisses me again, i kiss her back. She told me I had to fix the lock that I broke before they get back. Using paperglue and tippex i art and crafted the broken wooden keep before everyone got back home. \nNow in the living room she asked me if i was hungry and I said no and we both sat down on the coach and started watching tv. i had my arm around her and she had her head on my chest. We talked and it was great it was like she was my girlfriend. \nI touched her smooth thigh telling her I always wanted to do that, she laughed and said anytime.",
