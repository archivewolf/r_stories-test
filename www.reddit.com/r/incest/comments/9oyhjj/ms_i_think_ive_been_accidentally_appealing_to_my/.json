It did take a little bit of digging, so it wasn't something he was fully ready to admit but eventually he did say that he finds it arousing. Once he'd admitted that and I'd provided some reassurance he seemed much more comfortable elaborating that women hypnotising and exerting that control over men turns him on, and that he was pretty sure that attraction started with me.\n\nI lifted him back out of it, telling him not to remember admitting that stuff, since I don't want to suddenly make things akward before I know what I want to do with the information and that seems to be holding (or if he does remember he's not been acting differently the last day or so).\n\nSo that's the current situation, as with last time I welcome thoughts and opinions.",
