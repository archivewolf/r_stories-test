So I\u2019ll just say I knew my brother was into me because I\u2019d found some of my FB pictures on his computer stored with his porn folder. Started teasing him wearing certain clothes and such to see if he would stare. Eventually we talked he basically admitted he thought I was sexy. Some stuff ended up happening but we never actually had any real sexual contact between us until a little over a month later when I was in fact 18. So fast forward to 18, I went to my brothers room to watch a movie, still wasn\u2019t expecting anything to happen at this point all I had ever done is touch myself after he told me I was sexy and admitted that\u2019s why he got hard so I touched myself a few times to the thought of seeing him hard but clothed when I had him take some pictures for me to put on FB one night before I was going out with friends. I had on a really cute short tight strapless dress. So this particular night I was really tired yet told him I\u2019d watch the movie, at some point of laying there with him I must have dozed off. When I woke up I had my hand on his chest with my leg draped over his. So I rolled to my side and later I awoke to go pee but realized he was spooning me now his arm around my waist and I felt he was slightly hard. Kind of in a sleepy fog I started to move a little closer into him and felt it grow a little more. I came out of it and realized what I was doing and got up to leave. I went to the bathroom and not back to his room. Instead I went to my room and started to play with myself as I have before only this time it was just picturing his clothed hard on, this time I was pleasuring myself to the thought of him actually inside me. When I felt him pressed against me spooning and felt it get bigger as I deliberately pushed myself back further into him it triggered something inside me. Just the thoughts I had of us being intimate together had me wild inside. I must\u2019ve pleasured myself for a good while. The next few days were back to normal, walking around teasing him wearing revealing outfits, bending over or leaning over whenever our parents weren\u2019t around or were out of the house. Making sure he could get a peak of my cleavage or more. Acting as if it was accidental though. Then one weekend my parents were going away, it was a Thursday night and wouldn\u2019t be back until Sunday evening. That\u2019s when it all changed and became something that at the time I didn\u2019t understand but today and looking back on the years we\u2019ve shared it\u2019s something beyond anything I\u2019ve ever experienced in the most beautiful way possible. (I will post more later, I don\u2019t want to make these posts too long and I want to make sure I give as much back story to you guys because after you understand how this even came to be I\u2019m only gonna post about the most recent months and present day in hopes this can help others who feel troubled due to society labeling our love and lifestyle wrong)",
