At last she just sat there staring at nothing, so I went to the kitchen and made some tuna salad sandwiches.\nAfter we had eaten I did some work on my laptop then watched a little of the Jets/Browns game and went to bed early. She went to her room and I to mine.\nIn the morning she heard me leaving  and rushed out to say good bye. We hugged like we wouldn't see each other again.\nThen briefly kissed on the lips.\nLast night I took her out on a 'date' to a local burger and beer joint. We tried to talk a little but everything was still too raw and we couldn't sustain a conversation. Plus, the place was rather noisy so we would have had to talk loud and didn't want to be overheard.\nWhen we got home I didn't know what to do then. I really wanted  to sleep with her again but hesitated to ask.\nShe looked at me as if reading my thoughts then smiled an uncertain smile and said,\n\"Well husband, is it time to come back to our bed again?\"\n",
