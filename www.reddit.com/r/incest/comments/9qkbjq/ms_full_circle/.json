Like any relationship I've had with any woman, there were insecurities, annoying habits, that had to be endured whether it was mine or her's. Some would last a weeks, months, or a couple of precious years but never anything really lasting. That all changed after my mother and I became lovers.\n\nUnlike any normal relationship, my mother and I not only knew each other better than anyone else, our love and bond was cosanguineous. When I'm with my mother, I don't have to worry if maybe I cum a little to fast sometimes, or if our love life gets boring, even if the sex is rather vanilla. After almost 20 years of being on and off lovers, sex is still exciting considering the taboo aspect of our relationship. Why most men are jerking off to incest porn, and fantasizing about what it would be like to fuck their mom, I've been living a secret fantasy life most men dream of. When I think about that, I realize just how lucky, and special I feel to have this kind of relationship with my mother. Call me narracist, but that's just how I feel; privileged!\n\nHow many men out there have had their girlfriend, fiance, or wife cut them off from sex? That rarely happens with my mother. If my dick is hard, and we are somewhere that offers a fair amount of privacy, we're having sex! Nothing excites me more than flooding my mother's pussy with my seed while she moans for me to do it, and just going about the rest of our day as pretending to be nothing more than your ordinary mother and son.\n\nFor 5 years my mother and lived together as a couple in guise of a son caring for his poor widowed mother. It was the perfect cover and nobody, not even my younger siblings suspecting anything until my mother and I got a little to cavalier once and nearly got caught by my youngest sister. After that my mother got a little paranoid, and it was decided we would take a break and see other people. Sex between us slowly tapered off, and we eventually dated, and even got married to our future spouses years later. For a time things were returning to a normal mother son relationship for us, even if we were still somewhat emotionally attached to one another.\n\nEventually my second stepfather started having erectile dysfunction problems, and rather than get help, he did nothing. As a result their marriage suffered, and my mother and I ended up having another affair. Neither of us is proud of it, but it just seemed this incestous love we had for each other was stronger than any love either of us had ever expected. Sex with my wife became less and less, and eventually she asked me for a divorce. You'd think, hey you got your mother to take care of your needs man right? But I couldn't help but feel bad about having had my marriage fail for I genuinely loved my wife prior to my mother and I reigniting our consanguineous relationship. \n\nBy the time my mother and second stepfather finally divorced, we had been having an affair for years. My mother couldn't have been happier that it was just us again, and things quickly went back to the way they were before we split all those years ago. Although we didn't live together, we cohabited at each other's places on a regular basis. Things were coming full circle for my mother and I, and we both knew there was no point dating anyone else. My mother had no desire to be with anyone else, and I was the happiest I had been in years sharing a bed with my mother once again.\n\nJust over a month ago my mother and I agreed to live together again. I'm going on 45 this December, and my mother is turning 69 this February. Everyone thinks its sweet I'm letting my dear, old mother live with the me again. If only they knew the truth!",
