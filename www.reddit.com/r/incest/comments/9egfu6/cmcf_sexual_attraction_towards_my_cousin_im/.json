I've always had a crush on him ever since I knew about crushes. When we were little we often said that we would get married. Yeah, they moved away, and even though our family is very close-knit, I haven't got to see him that much, maybe once or twice a year. In July, he told me that he'll be coming back to my city after switching universities and I offered to help him through the moving process. So far so good.\n\nI went over to my aunt's place two days ago to specify the details of his moving and we met after like two years apart. He was just extremely nice and those two years did him good... BOOM...  and just like that, my baby-crush turned into full-on sexual attraction. He was all about those little touches we used to do waaay back, headlock, hand on the hips, on the thighs. Even with his brothers and parents there, while playing fucking UNO, I got turned on and had to masturbate for hours and needed multiple orgasms to get back on track after I went home. (This has never happened to me before.)\n\nI got used to my crush by now, but this just got very weird and idk what to do. I can't think about sleeping with anyone else but him and I'm just so fucking gone for him in such a short time, it's not funny anymore. Meanwhile, our family is very close (and very religious) and I am very anxious if I'm gonna ruin the dynamics if we (or just I) try to do something.\n\nThanks for any piece of advice you might've got for me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

Ours was more an adventure of exploration of ourselves, and understanding our sexuality. We were dumbfounded by relationships and used to share everything and seek advise from each other about our relationships and dating of the opposite sex, and that led to us experimenting with each other. We obviously finally had sex, we talked about everything though, about taking every care imaginable to prevent getting caught, promising never to talk to anyone about this. And years later, only the two of us know. It sounds like you two already have the chemistry in place for this to happen, so how you take it from here is wide open.

I would be very open though, that way with your cousin and figure out what each of you wants. Then, never tell anyone, not even friends about your relationship if it develops. \n\nMy cousin and i swore we would never become romantically involved, which may be different than what your seeking, and by doing that we got to enjoy each other in a way most people dont. Even today, we are still close and discuss everything, we havnt been sexually together in quite a few years, but we are ok with it. We still get together and talk about things we have done and relationship we have been in and how what we did many years before has helped us evolve in those relationships.\n\nGood luck with whatever your decision is.",
