Sorry, I know it's a bit long but I just need some good solid advice!\n\nI'm M24 and my cousin is 19F\n\nSo here's the deal, we practically never saw each other growing up, maybe once a year at the most. Recently, we had a family member who got married outside of where we live and we all decided to go. It was a great vacation because we both got to know each other extremely well. We practically hung out every day, all the time and for some reason she kept dropping these hints but I never took them seriously until now.\n\nEg. We were talking about guys she's into or guys she's dated, her reply was \"I'm definitely into older guys, I can't be with a younger guy. Someone older, like you.\"\n\nOr another time, I forgot what we were talking about but had said \"You'd be the perfect boyfriend, holy shit. Seriously.\"\n\nor another time was when she said \"I'm not into \\\\\\*\\\\\\*\\\\\\*\\\\\\*\\\\\\*\\\\\\* guys, but you're definitely different. Someone I'd consider.\" ( I put the \\\\\\*\\\\\\*\\\\\\*\\\\\\*\\\\\\*\\\\\\* because I wanted to block my ethnicity)\n\nAlso, while we were taking pictures during the wedding, she would always say \"Hold me closer, what's wrong with you\". One time I got a bit frustrated (not at her but other things) and she mentioned it, so I just grabbed her by the waist and literally brought her as close as possible for the picture and she whispered \"That's better, holy shit\"\n\nRecently, she moved to the city and she's going to university in the city and she kept on insisting that I come and visit her. I told her last week how I might just stay with her this Saturday and she said that was fine.\n\nWe started talking about how over protective I am, how my big brother instincts kick in and how I'd probably start a fight if someone was talking to her and etc,  I replied \"To avoid all of that, I'd just tell everyone the cute girl right there..she's my girl. No guys talk to you and plus I get to take the cute girl home.\" To which she replied \"make sure that cute girl gets home safely.\"\n\nThen a week or so later, we started talking about how I'd embarrass her in front of her friends and she replied \"I don't think you'd want to be seen around with a 19 year old.\", I replied \"I think it's the opposite\" and she said \"No, actually, I'd love to be around you and going out with you\"...\n\nSo here's my question, obviously we're cousins and obviously we're flirting a bit but how do I approach this ?  Do I stay over her place on Saturday ? Do I make my move then ? Do I wait until next time ?\n\nI really just don't know what to do and just need some advice on how to handle this situation.",
