And that went really smoothly! He thinks it's not a big deal, he believes me when I say it's all safe and good, and however much of that lifestyle I want to let him see is basically up to me. A load off my back for sure, haha...\n\nAnd then he came out as \"potentially trans\" to me, so... that's a new factor I suppose. I should probably explain something, the reason he's moving in with us is because he had a falling out with our parents and got kicked out. But I was unaware until today the falling out was over him trying to come out to them... Wish he would've told me sooner, could've tried to help him instead of overthinking my own stupid problems... Definitely would've just put the pet play on hold without a second thought.\n\nBut anyway, the important things are that he's not upset or uncomfortable at all with the idea of my pet life, and now I know what he's going through so I can help him however he needs me to. I guess it's a win-win but... I don't know, I don't know why I'm still freaking out like this haha. I guess the new wrinkle in the situation just knocked me back off balance, hope that's not awful of me to say... I'll try to get over it.\n\nUm, so that's what's going on now. I'm sorry my posts aren't very sexy compared to the normal stuff on here, lol. And just to be clear, I'm not trying to be insensitive with all my he's, hims, and \"brother\"s. He says he's still figuring everything out and it would feel funny for me to start calling him using feminine words immediately, just trying to respect his wishes. I'll try my best to \"switch over\" if/when he wants me to.\n\nOh, and I don't think I ever said when he's moving in, which is this friday. I know I really waited until the last minute to figure stuff out, I do that a lot, lol... Better late than never, although I still need to talk to my boyfriend about the new developments. And thank you everyone who took the time to respond to my last post, you have absolutely no idea how much it means to me!!!",
