I read the rules and feel like this fits.\n\nfor story, I have a twin sister whom I love very dearly, I would do anything for her. I treat her child as if she was mine. I've loved her for years. I'm not sure if it's the fact that she's a female equivalent or what. I would kill for her.\n\nSo, two nights ago I slept with my first tinder date. I know how stupid that sounds. I had spent a few days working on that, she bought me drinks and made me pho. I fucked her for waaaay too long. I did not come. I had a wet dream as a full fledged adult, I'm 25. I woke up cumming inside my sister in my dream. I messaged her right away, she asked me how it's going and everything. She told me about a weird panic attack she had at the store. I was so glad she messaged me back right away.\n\nWe were a little old to be bathing together, sleeping together, discovering life together. She is responsible for almost all of my first sexual experiences. All she had to do was say the word and her friends would show me their tits, even fuck me when we got a little older. This last hook up of mine showed it to me. I got physical with her about a year ago. I got weird while hanging out with her and put my hand up her shirt. She responded like I thought she would, confused and worried but calm.\n\nMy question is should I continue? I might be cursed.",

No. I was trying to refer to the weird sense of being lost that the two characters sort of experience.

I am well aware what's going on in my head. I am also a victim of sexual abuse, just got a soda with my abuser. \n\nI immediately realized people here are not prepared for real fucking people dealing with shit like this. I'm not a rapist, I'm not going to aggressively assault my family, I have extensive help with my mental state. I just can't really ask my professional therapist whom is talking me through being molested by my mother what to do about this situation I have with my twin. It's an extremely difficult situation for ME to understand so I fully understand how it is difficult for people to grasp. \n\nUpdate for that though. She asked me to hang out last night, we talked and got a late dinner.  I don't eat meat but she wanted a Midwest American staple food and I obliged. Was I peeling layers of skin away just desperately trying not to rape and murder the only person who knows anything about who I really am? No. I had a good time listening to music, catching up with her on how my niece is doing and eating a sandwich I dipped in mayonnaise. Although, I may be sick for the mayo part. It's really gross but I just love mayo and knew she wouldn't fuck with me for it. I really regret coming here for advice. \n\nEdit: I really appreciate you trying to help. Sorry if I sounded rude. You seem like a very kind individual with a lot of sentiment behind these thoughts. I am in a new relationship with a very sweet and accomadating girl, something I am not used to. The type who watched me have a panic attack and throw up in public at a coffee shop and consoled me. I do like the idea of maybe messing around with role play type stuff although the reasoning behind such things will most likely be a secret that I take to my grave. ",
