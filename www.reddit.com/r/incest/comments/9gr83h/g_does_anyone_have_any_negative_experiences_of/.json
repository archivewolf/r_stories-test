When we were done, we just plopped down on the couch to watch TV a bit before turning in. I was a little buzzed at this point, so I don't remember every little step, but this is when my dad and I ended up making out for the first time ever.\n\n\nIt was really hot, and really exciting for so many reasons. We'd been teasing each other so much, he was my dad obviously, plus Mom was asleep right upstairs which I know shouldn't have excited me but it did. We weren't touching each other too too much, just really enjoying legit making out, with some over-the-clothes rubbing. After all our teasing and texting though, I thought we were on the same page for going even further.\n\nMy dad had changed out of his nice clothing and put on some old basketball shorts to wear while he cleaned. While kissing one of my hands was on his bare thigh. I could see that he was kind of hard, so I thought it'd be sexy if I just did my best to slip my hand up the leg of his shorts.\n\nTouching my father's cock is still the most exhilarating memory I have. I had just managed to him in my hand and stroke him a couple of times before he finally realized what was happening. That's when he jumped up off the couch and turned his back to me. It was such an abrupt move it really shocked me. He had this really strange tone in his voice when he said we should probably get to bed. He walked upstairs and sat there and cried a bit because I felt like I messed things up between us. We didn't really talk meaningfully for about two months after.",
