I was staring at the ceiling, mentally replaying the previous few minutes of my life over and over in rapid succession. What did she just say? I dropped my head down and looked into the bathroom at Amy, sitting on the toilet and looking at me. She grinned and waved. The way she waves is the same she has always done it since we were kids. First she smiles, and her eyes squint when she does, which is how you know she\u2019s really smiling, and then she raises her arm, waits a second and waves her hand once. It is the Amy sign language version of \u201csup man?\u201d\n\nAmy is not a particularly girly girl. I mentioned before that she is objectively pretty, and she definitely has a fit body, but I have always thought of her somewhat androgenously, if that makes sense. Maybe it is because she is my sister, but I don\u2019t see her as a girl as much as I just see her as a person. I never had lustful feelings for her. Her personality in general is also very independent. She never seemed to care what other people thought of her, she didn\u2019t have a ton of friends, and the few that she did have were from her lacrosse team or the academic decathlon team. \u201cAcadeca\u201d is exactly what it sounds like; teams of smart kids compete in different subjects. The team called Amy the \"master-debater\" because of her oral skills. \\[Note: You know what? I am going to leave that sentence just the way it is.\\]\n\nAmy focused on her studies more than I did. She is objectively smarter than me, but more than that, she is more confident in a way. It\u2019s like she doesn\u2019t have insecurities that might make another person seek the approval of the \u201cin crowd\u201d or succumb to peer pressure in any way that I have ever seen. In high school she had an occasional beer at a party, but just because she was thirsty, whereas other girls were getting shitfaced and having blackout sex because they thought that\u2019s what you have to do. Not Amy though \u2013 she has always seemed to know exactly what she was doing, and she knew that it was the right thing, and she was always totally honest, maybe because she had nothing to hide. A lot of who I am is because of her positive influence on me, and I have always just respected her.\n\nStill looking at me, Amy wiped between her legs quickly, reached behind her to flush the toilet and jumped onto the bed, crashing into me on purpose.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve always wanted to do what?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat did you always want to do?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen?\u201d\n\n\u201cJust now.\u201d\n\n\u201cPee?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo. Before. After you swallowed your brother\u2019s cum. Do you remember that detail?\u201d\n\nShe laughed and lightly punched my arm. \u201cYes, I do recall something like that!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou said you always wanted to do that.\u201d\n\n\u201cI did.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid what?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat what?\u201d She said, cocking her head to the side. Then it dawned on her what I was asking. \u201cOH! No. I didn\u2019t mean I have always wanted to...do that to YOU, I meant I always wanted to do...that.\u201d\n\n\u201cWait. You\u2019ve done that before. You told me you did with Bobby.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I\u2019ve done that, but I haven\u2019t done THAT,\u201d she said matter-of-factly.\n\n\u201cWait I\u2019m confused,\u201d I said. \u201cYou haven\u2019t done what?\u201d\n\n\u201cSwallowed,\u201d she said. \u201cCan we back up a sec? I have never wanted to suck your dick,\u201d and when she said \u201csuck your dick\u201d she made air quotes with each word teasingly, \u201cuntil five minutes ago. I am not even sure I want to suck your dick,\u201d and she did the air quotes again, \u201cat all, but the thought of eating someone else\u2019s cum always grossed me out. For some reason, right now, with you, it wasn\u2019t gross.\u201d\n\n\u201cOhhh,\u201d I said. \u201cUm. Ok?\u201d\n\n\u201cActually David,\u201d she looked around her as if someone might be listening before continuing, \u201cI have secretly always wanted you and I lured you here to seduce you and kill you and later I am going to boil your rabbit.\u201d\n\n\u201cShut up,\u201d I said, and we were both laughing.\n\nShe patted my knee reassuringly. \u201cYou said it earlier today that we are in uncharted territory, and I obviously agree, but this isn\u2019t going to turn into a psychological thriller, I promise.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t suggesting that,\u201d I said. \u201cI just misunderstood.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah no big deal,\u201d she said, a big grin spreading over her face, \u201cBut that was awesome, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\n\u201cHold up,\u201d I said, \u201cFirst of all, yes, thank you, but are you telling me you have never, you know, swallowed?\u201d\n\n\u201cNope. Gross. Remember, I\u2019ve only been with two guys, ever. Seth was my first and you know how that went, so I didn\u2019t even get a dick anywhere near my face until Bobby, and even then it wasn\u2019t all that often and I would just sort of point it away or use my hand. I\u2019ve honestly only even done that a few times anyway.\u201d\n\n\u201cHuh,\u201d I said. \u201cReally.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d She said, \u201cIs that wrong?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, no, not at all,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cI mean, I\u2019ve also never had anyone stick their finger in my ass,\u201d she pushed me and started laughing. I felt my face burn slightly and I looked away, but she immediately jumped on me and hugged me, giggling. \u201cAnd it was awesome! Don\u2019t think for a minute you just took advantage of my virgin ass.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I prefer virgin ass.\u201d I said straight-faced, quoting one of our favorite movies, \u201cAll I\u2019m saying is that if you\u2019re going to eat a sandwich, you would enjoy it more if you knew no one had fucked it.\u201d\n\nShe laughed hard. Then she said, \u201cI\u2019m glad it was you, though. Honestly, I haven\u2019t spent nearly enough time on sex, and I still don\u2019t think I know what I\u2019m doing. I can do anything with you and it doesn\u2019t matter if I fuck it up.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell you definitely are not fucking up so far,\u201d I assured her. \u201cBesides,\u201d I said, \u201cIt\u2019s not that big of a deal. You just do what feels good and it just sort of falls into place, right?\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I mean, sex obviously feels good in general, but I just had the best orgasm of my short sexual career five minutes ago and I think it\u2019s mostly because I feel comfortable with you.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat and my finger in your ass?\u201d\n\nShe hit me with a pillow. \u201cYes, also that,\u201d she said. \u201cBy the way, seriously. Thanks for that. I mean, that was really erotic.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat it was,\u201d I said. \u201cShall we discuss the blowjob now or?\u201d\n\nNow she turned a bit red and smiled and looked down. \u201cWell, it wasn\u2019t technically a blowjob,\u201d she said, \u201cI just showed up at the end. But yeah. That was awesome. I don\u2019t know what I was expecting, but it wasn\u2019t that.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, it was like a compulsion,\u201d she started to explain, then was silent for a few seconds while she gathered her thoughts. She kneeled in front of me and placed her hands on my knees and continued. \u201cIt was like every fiber in my being wanted to suck your essence out of you and have it inside of me. The second I knew I was going to do it, my heart started beating so hard all of a sudden, and then when I put my mouth around your cock, I actually felt my pussy gush with wetness, and when you came, it was warm and forceful in my mouth, and when the first spurt filled my mouth, my pussy twitched a few times. I literally had another mini orgasm at the thought of swallowing your cum. And it just kept coming. Streams of hot cum filled my mouth, and the first two I swallowed quickly, but then the next few were smaller and I just let them fill my mouth to savor the moment. My whole body tingled with, like, electricity, if that makes sense, and I swallowed the rest and wanted more. I wanted you to fill me up. I would have stayed there, swallowing your cum for another half hour if that was an option.\u201d She looked down at the bed, lost in thought. \u201cYeah,\u201d she said. \u201cThat was truly mind-blowing.\u201d Then she cocked her head and smiled at me and tapped my knees with her hands.\n\nI took a few seconds to say anything. \u201cThat is the single best description of a blowjob I have ever heard,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cThanks,\u201d she said simply. \u201cI mean, do you know what I\u2019m saying? Has that ever happened to you?\u201d\n\n\u201cI have never sucked a dick, no.\u201d\n\n\u201cCome on, be serious,\u201d she said, but she was smiling. \u201cHave you ever had like a bodygasm when you were with a girl?\u201d\n\n\u201cTo be honest Amy,\u201d I said, \u201cThe best sex I have ever had has been co-masturbating with you this weekend.\u201d We both laughed every time we used the term now. \u201cI\u2019ve only had one more girlfriend than you\u2019ve had boyfriends, and I don\u2019t exactly get around.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s probably a good thing,\u201d she said, then added, \u201cThe good news is you can experiment with me now, since we\u2019re, you know, doing this now.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can? Like how?\u201d\n\n\u201cLike any way you want,\u201d she said, smirking. \u201cI mean, we\u2019ve established that it\u2019s not sexual, so,\u201d and she started laughing and I rolled my eyes, but she continued, \u201cso I mean, why not? We\u2019re obviously comfortable with each other, and this is obviously yet another thing we are taking to the grave. So I don\u2019t know, why not just learn from each other?\u201d\n\n\u201cCan I just say,\u201d I started, then stopped and looked at her for a few seconds before continuing. \u201cCan I just say that this is NOT how I expected the weekend to go?\u201d\n\nShe laughed and changed her position, sitting cross-legged in front of me now. \u201cI know! I know. But, well, everything happens for a reason, and I\u2019m learning to just go with it.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust go with it,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cYep.\u201d\n\n\u201cOk, well, now what?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cWhatever we want, I guess.\u201d\n\n\u201cLike, whatever?\u201d\n\n\u201cIs there something you\u2019d like to discuss, David?\u201d She asked, placing her hands on her hips.\n\n\u201cThere is, in fact.\u201d\n\n\u201cOk then. Out with it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want you to teach me to eat pussy,\" and I was surprised at the catch in my voice as I said it. \"Really well.\u201d My heart started beating harder. I cannot explain why, but thinking back on it, this was the first intentional thing between us. Everything else had just sort of happened in the moment. I felt strangely vulnerable. I half expected her to burst into laughter, or maybe throw me a witty comment, but she didn\u2019t. She looked at me for a few seconds, and her voice softened before she responded.\n\n\u201cCome over here, you,\u201d she said quietly, crawling backwards with her hands and laying down.\n\nI leaned forward and followed her. As she laid down on her back and spread her legs, I laid on my stomach between them.\n\n\u201cStart up here,\u201d she said, pointing to her neck.\n\nI pulled myself further up her body to reach her neck and looked at her expectantly. She turned her head to the side and brushed the long, taught tendon in her neck. \u201cHere,\u201d she said softly, \u201cgentle but firm.\u201d\n\nI opened my mouth and pressed it against her neck, sucking lightly, tasting her salty skin. My mouth watered and I swallowed hard. Amy put one hand on the back of my head and ran her fingers lightly through my hair. I had started at her clavical and was stretching up to the top of her neck when I became aware of the shaft of my cock pressed hard against her pubic bone. She was slowly, almost imperceptibly, grinding against it with her wet pussy.\n\n\u201cMmmm,\u201d she said in my ear, \u201cthat makes me tingle.\u201d After a few minutes, she gently pushed my head down with both of her hands to her chest. \u201cNow here,\u201d she whispered.\n\nI took her nipple in my mouth and sucked hard. She pulled back a bit and said, \u201cGentle. Always gentle. Swirl around it with your tongue. That\u2019s right. Now lightly suck. Mmmm. That\u2019s good. Now give me your finger.\u201d\n\nI offered my finger to her mouth and she sucked on it, swirling her tongue around it. Then she directed it toward her other nipple. While I swirled my tongue around her erect nipple, I mimicked the action with my finger on the other one. After a few minutes, she pushed my head further down to her abdomen. I looked up at her expectantly.\n\n\u201cMy belly button,\u201d she said. I gently licked around her navel and flicked at her piercing a bit, and then put my tongue deep in her navel and she arched her back and moaned.\n\n\u201cSome girls may not like that, but I LOVE it,\u201d she giggled and squirmed a bit when I went a little faster.\n\nAfter a few minutes, she put both of her hands on each side of my head and tugged me gently upward to look at her. She looked into my eyes and whispered, \u201cI want to feel my pussy in your mouth.\u201d\n\nI kissed my way down her stomach, then to her navel again, and then as I started to move below that, my heart started pounding and I felt her hands trembling as they gently held my head. A few seconds later I was kissing her smooth mound, and then I opened my mouth wide and plunged my tongue deep into her dripping wet pussy. Amy arched her back and panted hard.\n\n\u201cOh fuck,\u201d she said, and exhaled deeply. \u201cFuck David that feels so good.\u201d\n\nAll I could do is moan in agreement. Her pussy juices were smeared all over my mouth and were running down into the crack of her ass. With one of my fingers I gently pushed at her asshole and she pulled her legs up to give me better access.\n\n\u201cI was hoping you would do that,\u201d she panted as she pressed her asshole against my finger. \u201cOk now gently. My clit. Not on it, but around it.\u201d\n\nI obliged, being careful to avoid direct contact.\n\n\u201cNot up and down,\u201d she said, \u201cBut in circles. Slow circles. Oh fuck, that\u2019s it. Now push against the top with your tongue. Firm, but gentle.\u201d\n\nI got that I was supposed to do with my tongue what she does with her hands when she masturbates, so I pushed hard against the hood of her clit and circled slowly and she started grinding against my tongue while gently fucking my finger with her asshole. We got into a slow rhythm which sped up slightly, matching her quickened breathing.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to cum in your mouth,\u201d she whispered quickly. And then she did. I felt her asshole clench hard around my finger and I plunged my tongue deep into her pussy to feel her contractions on it. A gush of wetness filled my mouth and I swallowed it eagerly. I pushed my finger into her ass as far as it would go and she gasped as another hard contraction hit her. As her orgasm subsided, I continued to lightly graze my tongue across her pussy and she whimpered and bucked her hips involuntarily when I gently flicked her clit.\n\nFor a while we just laid there as her breathing returned to normal. I had my head on her stomach and she was lightly raking her fingers through my hair. I had my ear against her abdomen and could hear her pulse subside from its previous pounding. After a few minutes I looked up at her and she smiled.\n\n\u201cHow\u2019d I do?\u201d I smiled.\n\n\u201cYou dork,\u201d she laughed and pushed my head off her stomach. \u201cBut seriously, that was a pretty good start.\u201d We both laughed. We just laid there and didn\u2019t say anything for a while. I brushed her thigh with my fingers and she had her hand on my shoulder.\n\nAnd then her phone rang a couple of times and she sat up quickly.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s mom\u2019s ringtone,\u201d she said, laughing. \u201cShould we say hi?\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you fucking dare,\u201d I said.\n\nThen she jumped up and went to the table in the kitchen area and picked up her phone and held it up for me to see.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d I said.\n\nBut it was too late.\n\n\u201cHi mom,\u201d she answered with her sweetest voice. I rolled my eyes.\n\nI am not going to bore you with the details of that conversation, but the result was that our parents are taking us to Hawaii for winter break. They have a couple of time shares, and they exchanged one for a week in Maui. So, yay. It looks like the next time I see Amy will be in December. Amy has all kinds of ideas for how we are going to \u201cco-masturbate\u201d while on vacation in Maui, but I personally cannot see me getting into the mood if I have to look my parents in the eyes at breakfast the next morning. Who knows. I\u2019ll just go with it, as Amy would say.\n\nAmy and I had a long talk that night, and we decided that this was just the \u201cnew normal\u201d as she put it, but if either one of us ever felt bad or uncomfortable, that that would be the end of it, and we would both be cool with it.The next morning she drove me to the airport at zero dark thirty for an early flight back home. I got out and she walked around to the curb and gave me a big hug and a kiss on the cheek and that was that.",

I was staring at the ceiling, mentally replaying the previous few minutes of my life over and over in rapid succession. What did she just say? I dropped my head down and looked into the bathroom at Amy, sitting on the toilet and looking at me. She grinned and waved. The way she waves is the same she has always done it since we were kids. First she smiles, and her eyes squint when she does, which is how you know she\u2019s really smiling, and then she raises her arm, waits a second and waves her hand once. It is the Amy sign language version of \u201csup man?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Amy is not a particularly girly girl. I mentioned before that she is objectively pretty, and she definitely has a fit body, but I have always thought of her somewhat androgenously, if that makes sense. Maybe it is because she is my sister, but I don\u2019t see her as a girl as much as I just see her as a person. I never had lustful feelings for her. Her personality in general is also very independent. She never seemed to care what other people thought of her, she didn\u2019t have a ton of friends, and the few that she did have were from her lacrosse team or the academic decathlon team. \u201cAcadeca\u201d is exactly what it sounds like; teams of smart kids compete in different subjects. The team called Amy the &amp;quot;master-debater&amp;quot; because of her oral skills. [Note: You know what? I am going to leave that sentence just the way it is.]&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Amy focused on her studies more than I did. She is objectively smarter than me, but more than that, she is more confident in a way. It\u2019s like she doesn\u2019t have insecurities that might make another person seek the approval of the \u201cin crowd\u201d or succumb to peer pressure in any way that I have ever seen. In high school she had an occasional beer at a party, but just because she was thirsty, whereas other girls were getting shitfaced and having blackout sex because they thought that\u2019s what you have to do. Not Amy though \u2013 she has always seemed to know exactly what she was doing, and she knew that it was the right thing, and she was always totally honest, maybe because she had nothing to hide. A lot of who I am is because of her positive influence on me, and I have always just respected her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Still looking at me, Amy wiped between her legs quickly, reached behind her to flush the toilet and jumped onto the bed, crashing into me on purpose.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cYou\u2019ve always wanted to do what?\u201d I asked.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWhat?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWhat did you always want to do?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWhen?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cJust now.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cPee?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cNo. Before. After you swallowed your brother\u2019s cum. Do you remember that detail?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She laughed and lightly punched my arm. \u201cYes, I do recall something like that!\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cYou said you always wanted to do that.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI did.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cDid what?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWhat what?\u201d She said, cocking her head to the side. Then it dawned on her what I was asking. \u201cOH! No. I didn\u2019t mean I have always wanted to...do that to YOU, I meant I always wanted to do...that.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWait. You\u2019ve done that before. You told me you did with Bobby.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWell, I\u2019ve done that, but I haven\u2019t done THAT,\u201d she said matter-of-factly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWait I\u2019m confused,\u201d I said. \u201cYou haven\u2019t done what?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cSwallowed,\u201d she said. \u201cCan we back up a sec? I have never wanted to suck your dick,\u201d and when she said \u201csuck your dick\u201d she made air quotes with each word teasingly, \u201cuntil five minutes ago. I am not even sure I want to suck your dick,\u201d and she did the air quotes again, \u201cat all, but the thought of eating someone else\u2019s cum always grossed me out. For some reason, right now, with you, it wasn\u2019t gross.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cOhhh,\u201d I said. \u201cUm. Ok?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cActually David,\u201d she looked around her as if someone might be listening before continuing, \u201cI have secretly always wanted you and I lured you here to seduce you and kill you and later I am going to boil your rabbit.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cShut up,\u201d I said, and we were both laughing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She patted my knee reassuringly. \u201cYou said it earlier today that we are in uncharted territory, and I obviously agree, but this isn\u2019t going to turn into a psychological thriller, I promise.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI wasn\u2019t suggesting that,\u201d I said. \u201cI just misunderstood.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cYeah no big deal,\u201d she said, a big grin spreading over her face, \u201cBut that was awesome, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cHold up,\u201d I said, \u201cFirst of all, yes, thank you, but are you telling me you have never, you know, swallowed?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cNope. Gross. Remember, I\u2019ve only been with two guys, ever. Seth was my first and you know how that went, so I didn\u2019t even get a dick anywhere near my face until Bobby, and even then it wasn\u2019t all that often and I would just sort of point it away or use my hand. I\u2019ve honestly only even done that a few times anyway.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cHuh,\u201d I said. \u201cReally.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWhy?\u201d She said, \u201cIs that wrong?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cNo, no, not at all,\u201d I said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI mean, I\u2019ve also never had anyone stick their finger in my ass,\u201d she pushed me and started laughing. I felt my face burn slightly and I looked away, but she immediately jumped on me and hugged me, giggling. \u201cAnd it was awesome! Don\u2019t think for a minute you just took advantage of my virgin ass.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWell, I prefer virgin ass.\u201d I said straight-faced, quoting one of our favorite movies, \u201cAll I\u2019m saying is that if you\u2019re going to eat a sandwich, you would enjoy it more if you knew no one had fucked it.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She laughed hard. Then she said, \u201cI\u2019m glad it was you, though. Honestly, I haven\u2019t spent nearly enough time on sex, and I still don\u2019t think I know what I\u2019m doing. I can do anything with you and it doesn\u2019t matter if I fuck it up.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWell you definitely are not fucking up so far,\u201d I assured her. \u201cBesides,\u201d I said, \u201cIt\u2019s not that big of a deal. You just do what feels good and it just sort of falls into place, right?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cMaybe,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I mean, sex obviously feels good in general, but I just had the best orgasm of my short sexual career five minutes ago and I think it\u2019s mostly because I feel comfortable with you.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cThat and my finger in your ass?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She hit me with a pillow. \u201cYes, also that,\u201d she said. \u201cBy the way, seriously. Thanks for that. I mean, that was really erotic.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cThat it was,\u201d I said. \u201cShall we discuss the blowjob now or?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now she turned a bit red and smiled and looked down. \u201cWell, it wasn\u2019t technically a blowjob,\u201d she said, \u201cI just showed up at the end. But yeah. That was awesome. I don\u2019t know what I was expecting, but it wasn\u2019t that.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWell, it was like a compulsion,\u201d she started to explain, then was silent for a few seconds while she gathered her thoughts. She kneeled in front of me and placed her hands on my knees and continued. \u201cIt was like every fiber in my being wanted to suck your essence out of you and have it inside of me. The second I knew I was going to do it, my heart started beating so hard all of a sudden, and then when I put my mouth around your cock, I actually felt my pussy gush with wetness, and when you came, it was warm and forceful in my mouth, and when the first spurt filled my mouth, my pussy twitched a few times. I literally had another mini orgasm at the thought of swallowing your cum. And it just kept coming. Streams of hot cum filled my mouth, and the first two I swallowed quickly, but then the next few were smaller and I just let them fill my mouth to savor the moment. My whole body tingled with, like, electricity, if that makes sense, and I swallowed the rest and wanted more. I wanted you to fill me up. I would have stayed there, swallowing your cum for another half hour if that was an option.\u201d She looked down at the bed, lost in thought. \u201cYeah,\u201d she said. \u201cThat was truly mind-blowing.\u201d Then she cocked her head and smiled at me and tapped my knees with her hands.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I took a few seconds to say anything. \u201cThat is the single best description of a blowjob I have ever heard,\u201d I said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cThanks,\u201d she said simply. \u201cI mean, do you know what I\u2019m saying? Has that ever happened to you?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI have never sucked a dick, no.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cCome on, be serious,\u201d she said, but she was smiling. \u201cHave you ever had like a bodygasm when you were with a girl?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cTo be honest Amy,\u201d I said, \u201cThe best sex I have ever had has been co-masturbating with you this weekend.\u201d We both laughed every time we used the term now. \u201cI\u2019ve only had one more girlfriend than you\u2019ve had boyfriends, and I don\u2019t exactly get around.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cThat\u2019s probably a good thing,\u201d she said, then added, \u201cThe good news is you can experiment with me now, since we\u2019re, you know, doing this now.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI can? Like how?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cLike any way you want,\u201d she said, smirking. \u201cI mean, we\u2019ve established that it\u2019s not sexual, so,\u201d and she started laughing and I rolled my eyes, but she continued, \u201cso I mean, why not? We\u2019re obviously comfortable with each other, and this is obviously yet another thing we are taking to the grave. So I don\u2019t know, why not just learn from each other?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cCan I just say,\u201d I started, then stopped and looked at her for a few seconds before continuing. \u201cCan I just say that this is NOT how I expected the weekend to go?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She laughed and changed her position, sitting cross-legged in front of me now. \u201cI know! I know. But, well, everything happens for a reason, and I\u2019m learning to just go with it.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cJust go with it,\u201d I said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cYep.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cOk, well, now what?\u201d I asked.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWhatever we want, I guess.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cLike, whatever?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cIs there something you\u2019d like to discuss, David?\u201d She asked, placing her hands on her hips.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cThere is, in fact.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cOk then. Out with it.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI want you to teach me to eat pussy,&amp;quot; and I was surprised at the catch in my voice as I said it. &amp;quot;Really well.\u201d My heart started beating harder. I cannot explain why, but thinking back on it, this was the first intentional thing between us. Everything else had just sort of happened in the moment. I felt strangely vulnerable. I half expected her to burst into laughter, or maybe throw me a witty comment, but she didn\u2019t. She looked at me for a few seconds, and her voice softened before she responded.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cCome over here, you,\u201d she said quietly, crawling backwards with her hands and laying down.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I leaned forward and followed her. As she laid down on her back and spread her legs, I laid on my stomach between them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cStart up here,\u201d she said, pointing to her neck.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I pulled myself further up her body to reach her neck and looked at her expectantly. She turned her head to the side and brushed the long, taught tendon in her neck. \u201cHere,\u201d she said softly, \u201cgentle but firm.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I opened my mouth and pressed it against her neck, sucking lightly, tasting her salty skin. My mouth watered and I swallowed hard. Amy put one hand on the back of my head and ran her fingers lightly through my hair. I had started at her clavical and was stretching up to the top of her neck when I became aware of the shaft of my cock pressed hard against her pubic bone. She was slowly, almost imperceptibly, grinding against it with her wet pussy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cMmmm,\u201d she said in my ear, \u201cthat makes me tingle.\u201d After a few minutes, she gently pushed my head down with both of her hands to her chest. \u201cNow here,\u201d she whispered.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I took her nipple in my mouth and sucked hard. She pulled back a bit and said, \u201cGentle. Always gentle. Swirl around it with your tongue. That\u2019s right. Now lightly suck. Mmmm. That\u2019s good. Now give me your finger.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I offered my finger to her mouth and she sucked on it, swirling her tongue around it. Then she directed it toward her other nipple. While I swirled my tongue around her erect nipple, I mimicked the action with my finger on the other one. After a few minutes, she pushed my head further down to her abdomen. I looked up at her expectantly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cMy belly button,\u201d she said. I gently licked around her navel and flicked at her piercing a bit, and then put my tongue deep in her navel and she arched her back and moaned.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cSome girls may not like that, but I LOVE it,\u201d she giggled and squirmed a bit when I went a little faster.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After a few minutes, she put both of her hands on each side of my head and tugged me gently upward to look at her. She looked into my eyes and whispered, \u201cI want to feel my pussy in your mouth.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I kissed my way down her stomach, then to her navel again, and then as I started to move below that, my heart started pounding and I felt her hands trembling as they gently held my head. A few seconds later I was kissing her smooth mound, and then I opened my mouth wide and plunged my tongue deep into her dripping wet pussy. Amy arched her back and panted hard.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cOh fuck,\u201d she said, and exhaled deeply. \u201cFuck David that feels so good.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All I could do is moan in agreement. Her pussy juices were smeared all over my mouth and were running down into the crack of her ass. With one of my fingers I gently pushed at her asshole and she pulled her legs up to give me better access.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI was hoping you would do that,\u201d she panted as she pressed her asshole against my finger. \u201cOk now gently. My clit. Not on it, but around it.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I obliged, being careful to avoid direct contact.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cNot up and down,\u201d she said, \u201cBut in circles. Slow circles. Oh fuck, that\u2019s it. Now push against the top with your tongue. Firm, but gentle.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got that I was supposed to do with my tongue what she does with her hands when she masturbates, so I pushed hard against the hood of her clit and circled slowly and she started grinding against my tongue while gently fucking my finger with her asshole. We got into a slow rhythm which sped up slightly, matching her quickened breathing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI\u2019m going to cum in your mouth,\u201d she whispered quickly. And then she did. I felt her asshole clench hard around my finger and I plunged my tongue deep into her pussy to feel her contractions on it. A gush of wetness filled my mouth and I swallowed it eagerly. I pushed my finger into her ass as far as it would go and she gasped as another hard contraction hit her. As her orgasm subsided, I continued to lightly graze my tongue across her pussy and she whimpered and bucked her hips involuntarily when I gently flicked her clit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For a while we just laid there as her breathing returned to normal. I had my head on her stomach and she was lightly raking her fingers through my hair. I had my ear against her abdomen and could hear her pulse subside from its previous pounding. After a few minutes I looked up at her and she smiled.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cHow\u2019d I do?\u201d I smiled.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cYou dork,\u201d she laughed and pushed my head off her stomach. \u201cBut seriously, that was a pretty good start.\u201d We both laughed. We just laid there and didn\u2019t say anything for a while. I brushed her thigh with my fingers and she had her hand on my shoulder.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then her phone rang a couple of times and she sat up quickly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWhat?\u201d I asked.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cThat\u2019s mom\u2019s ringtone,\u201d she said, laughing. \u201cShould we say hi?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cDon\u2019t you fucking dare,\u201d I said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then she jumped up and went to the table in the kitchen area and picked up her phone and held it up for me to see.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d I said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it was too late.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cHi mom,\u201d she answered with her sweetest voice. I rolled my eyes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am not going to bore you with the details of that conversation, but the result was that our parents are taking us to Hawaii for winter break. They have a couple of time shares, and they exchanged one for a week in Maui. So, yay. It looks like the next time I see Amy will be in December. Amy has all kinds of ideas for how we are going to \u201cco-masturbate\u201d while on vacation in Maui, but I personally cannot see me getting into the mood if I have to look my parents in the eyes at breakfast the next morning. Who knows. I\u2019ll just go with it, as Amy would say.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Amy and I had a long talk that night, and we decided that this was just the \u201cnew normal\u201d as she put it, but if either one of us ever felt bad or uncomfortable, that that would be the end of it, and we would both be cool with it.The next morning she drove me to the airport at zero dark thirty for an early flight back home. I got out and she walked around to the curb and gave me a big hug and a kiss on the cheek and that was that.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
