Feel free to post other objections in the comments and I will respond to each one.\n\nThe point here is not to claim that \"incest is best\". **Incest is NOT best. Incest is not normal.** It can destroy otherwise healthy sibling relationships, it can cause serious genetic harm to offspring, and can be hurtful to healthy relationships and functioning. **However** the taboo against consenting adults, who happen to be related, engaging in a relationship, needs to go away. Because - **consenting, adults.**\n\nIt doesn't need to make it's way into any mainstream environment or normalized as just something to do. But - when two people decide to engage in it, they shouldn't be ostracized for who they love. \"Oh hey there's that house with the two gay guys.\" doesn't need to be any different than \"Oh hey there's that house with the couple that's related.\"\n\n**Objection: Incest results in offspring with serious health issues, so it is wrong.**\n\n**Response:** We do not forbid people with genetic health issues who are unrelated from reproducing. We respect the legal rights of their ability to have a relationship, because their individual rights to have a relationship are established in norms and in law. Although the chances for genetic issues are significantly higher among siblings - that does not justify forbidding their right to have a relationship. There may be a valid case to forbid reproduction among first-order relatives. Yet even this would be less draconian that the current framework that places a taboo and legal restriction on a relationship.\n\nIf relationships are to be based on the chances of genetically caused disease, it would require blanket prohibitions on many many more classes of people from marrying. This objection has nothing to truly do with reproduction, and is based in prejudice when a simple remedy could be applied to make the prohibition reproduction with a sibling, not sexual intercourse or romantic relationships.\n\n**Objection: Incest is religiously prohibited in the Bible**\n\n**Response 1:**\nGenesis 20:12, Abraham says about Sarah: \"Besides, she really is my sister, the daughter of my father though not of my mother; and she became my wife.\"\n\nAdditionally, there is no way Adam and Eve, if the story is taken literally, could possibly be the root of human life if incestuous relationships among their children did not start it all. Sibling incest is, according to the Bible, the very fountain of humanity, the beginning of its existence as a race, and the beginning of the line of ancestors and descendants that would eventually result in the birth of Jesus.\n\nThe point here is that the prohibition against incest is clearly NOT a moral one, a spiritual one, or a universal one. It is a legal one. This relationship is later forbidden in the Bible but if someone who believes in the Bible reflects deeply on this, they have to admit that Jesus himself, is a direct descendant of this relationship. Without this relationship, there is no Jesus being born.\n\n**Response 2:** If Jesus was responsible for lifting the burden of the Law of the Scripture, except the ones which mandated the protection of other's rights, there's no reason to imagine this is not under the same purview.\n\n**Response 3:** Not everyone believes in the Bible. Your objection is irrelevant. And the Bible itself has the aforementioned examples of incest occurring in what are unions that are blessed by God. If someone does not believe in the Law of the Bible, all that is left is its moral exhortations, and clearly, there's nothing morally wrong with incest considering the story of Adam and Eve or Adam and Sarah. it is a later legal prohibition in the Torah.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n**Objection: Power dynamics means someone is being taken advantage of in the relationship. It can never be healthy.**\n\n**Response:** Power dynamics are a central part of every marriage and sexual relationship, starting from the very idea of having a breadwinner. Breadwinners have the ability to throw their families out on the street and withhold important resources of care. Is that not a real, physical power dynamic? Yet we do not object to these very normal relationships because these are the realities of life and there is nothing actually wrong with the relationship if the two adults involved find it to be enriching, fulfilling, and not obstructive to any normal functioning of life, friendships, relationships, activities, and health of all kinds - mental, emotional, physical.\n\nThe objection is based in the fear of grooming, or the existence of a power dynamic in emotions. The same can easily exist, and does, in romantic relationships where the emotional vulnerabilities of one partner are preyed upon by the other to the point that the victimized partner is essentially kept in a cycle of emotional abuse. We don't outlaw regular relationships because this sometimes occurs. The case is the same for adult sibling relationships. They can be perfectly consenting, healthy, and fully mature individual entering into a relationship with their eyes wide open.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n**Objection: There are so many other people in the world. Why did you have to pick your own sibling?**\n\n**Response:** Because I love this person in a way that exceeds a sibling relationship, and vice-versa. Your question is not an objection but a result of confusion. You don't understand why I want to be with this person for the rest of my life. You don't have to. All you need to know is that both of us have chosen it freely, and do not plan to force you to do the same, nor to prohibit you from making your own personal choices.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n**Objection: This is not like homosexuality because...It is not a choice**\n\n\n**Response:** You have just argued that homosexuality, if chosen or experimented freely, and then chosen as a lifestyle due to said experimentation - is less valid that homosexuality that is attributed to physiological causes. You probably want to step away from this position because it is likely inconsistent with your values. Such a position might be consistent if one holds it, however it surrenders the argument against incest on another point. Falling in love with an individual and finding them sexually or romantically attractive is also, not a choice. If a gay person falls in love with someone of the same gender - they are not faulted for this attraction. If a person is attracted to a sibling - the same freedom should apply to them. Again, consenting adults.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n**Objection: This is not like homosexuality because...Homosexuality does not result in dangerous reproduction**\n\n**Response:** This was addressed in the first response. Incestuous reproduction is not being advocated. What is being advocated is the same right that all others adults seem to be receiving in first-world societies - that consenting adults with the ability to reason - are allowed to engage in sexual relationships with other adults who have the same qualities.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n\n**Objection: Incest causes the breakdown of families**\n\n**Response:** Due to this taboo. The taboo is the reason that families can be hurt as a result of this action. This is a self-fulfilling prophecy, not an objection. If the relationship type is not ostracized, it wouldn't be a problem. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Objection: \"It is disgusting.\"**\n\n**Response:** One would argue that sticking a human penis, which is a reproductive organ that is not meant for an anal opening, into an anus which is teeming with incredibly harmful bacteria, pathogens, and waste - is disgusting. One is essentially having sex with the remnants of feces as a lubricant. Yet this is not seen as disgusting in first-world countries for men or women, whether hetero or homosexual. What is disgusting about standard sexual intercourse between two consenting adults just because they are related? Nothing. This is an subjective declaration of feeling, not a real objection.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Objection: If we open this door, it will destroy sibling relationships everywhere as teenage siblings start to experiment with each other.**\n\n**Response:** Your assumption that the reason siblings don't experiment when living in the same home is based entirely on prohibiting adult siblings from having a relationship is erroneous and unproven. Siblings normally simply do not find each other attractive due to evolution - namely the Westermarck Effect. Our brains naturally reject this relationship normally due to the dangerous potential effects in offspring. Allowing a handful of adults who are affected by GSA (Genetic Sexual Attraction) or have their own consensual reasons for engaging in a relationship will not magically destroy the Westermarck Effect which",
