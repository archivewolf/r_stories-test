Feels like just yesterday I was hopelessly into my own mom with no way to vent my feelings, and now look at us, haha...\n\nWell, I need to say something right away, something that should've been said earlier but neither me or Al got around to it. The whole thing about my mom wanting me to give her a child was mostly a misunderstanding on Al's part. There's nothing to worry about, my mom's not that crazy, and since then she's turned a little on the idea of having another baby at all, after considering the logistics and realities of such an idea. She's still open to the idea if she meets the right guy, but that guy ain't me.\n\nAnd that little misunderstanding aside, things have been great between us and mom. She's been very helpful and supportive when we need her to be while still letting us \"do our own thing\", and we've been visiting back and forth pretty frequently without it really effecting our independence at all. And it's not just for sex or anything, I've only had two noteworthy sexual run-ins with my mom as of late, one I'll get to in a minute, and the other was just a random quiet moment together than ended with a blowjob. Our relationship these days feels more like a really good friendship than anything. And I think it's the best place our relationship has ever been in, honestly. Maybe it's just nice to feel like an equal adult, I'm not sure, but you get the idea. As for her and Al, they have their own dynamic going on, but it's working perfectly fine for them as far as I can tell. Let's just say, with all hatchets buried and all grudges behind them, there's not a lot stopping them from having sex whenever they feel like it, haha...\n\nAnd then there's me and Al. We're still going strong, although I'd say we've drifted back towards the siblings spectrum rather than straight up lovers. And that's totally okay for us. I think I was waiting in vain for the moment where she felt more like a girlfriend than my sister, but that's not gonna happen, and I think we're better off. She's still the same weird and goofy older sister I grew up with, can't change that, and I don't want to. We've joked that the only thing that MIGHT force our sibling dynamic to change would be having kids, and even that's just a maybe (And we're not trying for kids, so don't worry). But we're still having sex, so don't worry about that either I guess, haha.\n\nAnd since I already mentioned it (And because Al apparently misses me talking in too much detail about sexual encounters), I guess I'll talk about Sunday night. I was out for most of the day, and when I got home (me and Al's home) I found mom and Al in their underwear with an open wine bottle. Mom seemed to be mostly in her right mind, but Al giggled like a maniac and stumbled over to give me a hug and a kiss. I asked what the occasion was, the response was \"skin bonding\", I asked what that meant, I only got giggles in return. Apparently Al had the drunken idea that she and mom should strip down and simply cuddle in various positions with as much skin contact as possible (\"But not sexually\", as Al felt the need to state over and over). So I got to witness an example of Al sitting on mom's lap, arms around eachother, bodies pressed together, cheek to cheek and with eyes closed. And after boozing up a little myself (Hope I don't get in trouble for admitting that, it was actually my mom's idea, hah), I stripped down to my boxers, we moved to my and Al's bed for more room, and we got very close and touchy-feely before settling into a position and staying there for a while. A little hard to explain it, but our mom was between me and Al, and we both had as much skin pressed into her as possible, and had a leg over one of her legs.\n\nIt was legitimately nicer than I expected, and we stayed like that for close to half an hour. And I think we only stopped because Al, well, got horny. She started grinding herself on mom's leg in a way that we couldn't not notice, and then she started feeling up mom with one hand and my boxers with the other. Mom acted like she didn't notice, up until she propped herself up and undid her bra, prompting some groping from Al before she got up, removed her own bra, and laid down on top of mom, boobs-to-boobs. Al laughed and said they should've started with this position, mom only laughed. I figured they would stay like that and continue the \"non-sexual\" cuddling, until they started making out. I just stared in my own alcohol-induced daze until mom said to \"Take your girlfriend's panties off\", which I did, and Al said \"Hers too\". After performing the doubly illegal act of stripping my sister and mother naked, I watched they slowly rub each other for a minute or two, and then, well, I decided to hop up and grab either a condom or anal lube, hadn't decided which when Al asked where I was going. I told her, and mom said \"Pills are on me tomorrow, come take care of your sister\". And so, after getting on the bed, attempting some foreplay, and being told \"Just fuck me\", I just fucked her, Al that is. It was fairly calm and quiet as far as sex goes, I think the atmosphere of the weird skin bonding time was bleeding over, but it was great nonetheless. Mom had her hands on Al's butt, and was whispering things like \"Good, keep going, faster\", and I think I have that to blame for cumming too fast, haha... At least mom was on the case and helped get Al off around the same time, that's always the ideal I think.\n\nBut no rest for the wicked, mom had Al turn around in almost no time and started eating her out, and Al in turn was lazily messing with my penis, both with her hands and mouth. And I wasn't nearly ready to go again when she mumbled \"Here next\" and lead me to mom's vagina, and she basically tried to stuff it inside half-soft. Not sure what she was thinking, or if she was thinking, but I recovered eventually and began round 2 inside my mom. And from here it's all a bit of a daze, but I know I was doing my mom doggy style while she continued to eat out Al by the time I came again. And just like she did with Al, she timed her orgasm to match up with mine, and that was the loudest anyone got that night, haha. After that, we just sort of passed out one by one as far as I can remember. \n\nAnd then it was back to our new normal the next day, mom went back home and me and Al have continued to \"Do our thing\". I'm getting feedback from Al that I've lost my writing touch, I'm not sure what she means or if I had the touch to begin with but okay. I'll also say we've started another massage routine back up, apparently we're both weirdly nostalgic for that time in our lives, even if it was only months ago.\n\nAnyway, that's probably both too much and too little about what's been going on with us lately, somehow. Sorry for the absence, life really gets in the way, especially now that we're on our own. I'll try to pop in here and there if there's something fun to talk about.\n\nUntil then, later.",
