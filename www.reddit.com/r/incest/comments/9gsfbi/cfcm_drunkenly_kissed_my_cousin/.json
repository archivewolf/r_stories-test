The only thing I considered weird was when I was 16 and he asked me if I was still a virgin and if I would lose it to any guy. We're both 21 now, but we rarely see each other or communicate. I'm away for college and he works all the time. There was a party over the weekend and there was well over 300 guests of family and other distant family members. He is my first cousin and we got to the party at the same time. He came over to greet me since it had been months since we last saw each other and then we sat at the same table. Later on we went to a table towards the back where other cousins our age were hanging out and drinking. We started to just catch up over drinks and it was perfectly fine. I started to feel drunk after a while and I don't know how he convinced me to go outside. We were walking and talking and then I just remember that we were in his car. I was still talking and then he told me to look at him, so I did and he immediately began to kiss me. I feel awful because I began to say he was my cousin but then I just ended up letting it happen. He would stop and tell me how he's always wanted this between us since we were young and that he knew I'd be scared because we were cousins. After making out for a while he ate me out and I also gave him head. He then wanted to have sex and also told me he knew I was still a virgin and that I was hiding it from him but I shouldn't be worried with him. Then I just remember constantly saying no to him and I ended up getting out of the car because I wanted to throw up.\n\nNow I'm out of town again but I feel really bad about the whole thing. I'm also afraid that someone saw us because we just randomly disappeared. It's been bothering me a lot..\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat should I do??",
