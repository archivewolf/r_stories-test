I told him he doesn't have to, it's whatever, no big deal. He got embarrassed though when I said we could hear him trying to do butt stuff, lol, he's been toning it down...\n\nThe other big thing is I just got done with about 48 hours of continuous \"pet mode\", and I was naked for most of it. The short version is there was a new source of intense stress of anxiety over the weekend, and I just had to let go and let pet mode make me feel better, brother or no brother... And it was pretty much fine. It's actually kind of exciting, having two trustworthy people around to play with when I'm being a pet. And yeah... by exciting I mean sexually, at least a little bit. Even if I can ignore that excitement as a pet or pretend it's something other than arousal, I'll admit arousal is part of it... Guess it was impossible to avoid. But the thing is I'm not too bothered by that fact, especially not in pet mode, so... just gonna keep seeing where things go, I don't know.\n\nI think that's mostly everything, a tiny bit short on time right now, sorry...",
