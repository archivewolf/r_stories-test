I listed the positives there: https://old.reddit.com/user/marriedtosister/comments/7u7zxn/bs_how_consensual_adult_sibling_incest_can_be_a/\n\nHowever, I sometimes think there isn't enough out here about the challenges of being married to your sister or brother, or having them as a long-term life partner. I thought I'd try and address a few of many here.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n \n\n**The fear of being found out.** We live with this fear constantly to the point that sometimes it turns into a physical headache. You are always worried if someone knows, if someone, somehow from your hometown will show up here. If someone will look you up and find you despite all the precautions you've taken. If you will lose your job, friends, community, everything you've fought for. It is like a constant ache in your back and head that doesn't go away. Sometimes it has stressed us out to the point that we've gotten into fights and realized, we're just stressed. We've worked on this a lot by finding out own ways to release the tension, and to realize that there's really nothing we can do if we're found out. That \"we\" are worth it no matter what, and that we're just going to keep on going. My sister (I'll refer to her as Sarah for the rest of the post) seems to do a lot better than me with it. We've both realized the exercise really helps with the stress and thankfully it has gotten much better over the years, or we've just grown adapted to it. I don't think it about it very much, but sometimes it just pops out of nowhere and I'll start breathing hard, afraid for two seconds that someone knows.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n**Being so familiar with each other that it seems there's nothing to explore/discover.** This is one that almost all couples can fall into when you've known each other long enough. When you are a sibling couple, you almost start off this way. There is definitely a period though - a honeymoon period - where you learn all kinds of AMAZING things about your sibling that they never ever showed you as a sibling. Their most secret thoughts, dreams, aspirations, little private hopes. Things that you pretty much only tell a spouse. Stuff that a normal sibling might even get bored by hearing from you. That period is *incredible* because it changes your perception of someone you thought you knew like the back of your hand, and shows you a side of them that is so deep, and colorful, and amazing. However, after this period is over it becomes too easy to fall into hold habits and patterns. Then you start almost getting bored. You know their thoughts on everything, and you know their entire history. There aren't that many childhood stories to tell - you were there - you were part of their childhood.\n\nThe antidote to this is something that can help married couples everywhere. Keep growing! Once we realized we were stuck in a rut, we decided we weren't boring each other because of a problem we had with each other. We were boring each other because we had become boring people. Comfortable. We snapped out of it and started taking up hobbies we always dreamed of. Sarah volunteers at a few charities and I have a few hobbies that I work on and one volunteer activity that I help with. I started taking random classes on topics I found interesting. We started *growing* as people. When we come back from our \"things\" we have stories to tell. We have people to talk about. We have new friends to invite over. We have a LIFE. Seeing her grow and change and learn, and being able to share my own growth with her, is an essential part of keeping us from boring each other. I'd imagine we had it hard because of our unique situation, but this seems to affect everyone. And - you absolutely have to maintain a social life of three circles. Her circle of friends. My circle of friends. Our circle of friends with some overlapping family friends. We have to make sure we put in effort to encourage each others' social lives. \n \n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n**The inability to lie to each other** We just can't get away with lying to each other. Neither of us are amazing at it to begin with, but on top of that, we know each other's tells. TV shows portray tells as like some kind of secret physical code where you can tell because a hair on their eyelash is vibrating out of sync with the rest etc etc. We know when the other person is lying almost always just from voice alone. Tone is enough. I come home, she asks me how my day was, and I say: \"It was good!\" because she texted me how tired she is before I got home and I don't want to burden her with my day. She knows immediately my day wasn't all that good because of the tone. \n\nThe lying breaks trust, like in any relationship, and even though we let each other get away with small things, in general - we just try really hard not to lie to each other. It is hard, because everyone lies. Everyone lies to their spouse at some level, sometimes says something passive-aggressive, something. We found that it is doubly destructive to us because we know we aren't *really* getting away with it. So - we tell the truth. Sounds simple enough but it is not. It is hard to state every grievance almost immediately so that it doesn't sit and to maintain the environment of honesty. Sometimes, you don't want to share what you're upset about and that should be OK. We've gotten to a point where we admit something is bothering us and ask if we can talk about it later. This way, we don't cover up things or brush them under the rug, and at the same time, don't feel stifled and claustrophobic living with a person you love with all your heart but pretty much can't hide anything from.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n**Largely cutting off friends from your old life who you can't trust with your secret** This was one of the most difficult aspects of this life. We lost a lot of friends. We didn't break ties with them formally or anything. We just disappeared. We're not on social media. We're not on LinkedIn. We're not easy to find if someone looked for us. Emotionally, this was tough on us when we made the decision to be together. We lost a lot of close friends and people that enriched our lives since we were kids. There are a small handful that know we live together, and there are a smaller handful that know about the relationship. This is a huge sacrifice that cannot be overestimated in terms of its impact on your social lives. There is no way of getting around this other than to build new friendships with people who don't know you from your origin. They know you grew up in the same town. You don't provide a lot of historical details, but you engage in an otherwise honest relationship with them. It is sometimes surreal to me that we've thrown parties for our friends, had them come over and hang out with us, and for years, they know us as nothing more than a regular family that lives on the block. These friendships are really important, because that becomes your social life. Sacrificing some of your best friendships because you simply are not sure if they will accept you, messes you up a little. \n\n\n&amp;nbsp; \n\n**The inability to rely on each other for relationship help** Normally, siblings will call each other up when struggling in a relationship and have a shoulder to learn on. We don't. It is only the two of us. So when we do need a shoulder to lean on about the relationship - which is not too often anymore but still happens from time to time - it has to be a friend. There's no other answer to this except one. You each need one or two really, really close friends that you can talk to about your marriage. It helps if they know the secret about your marriage, but even if they don't - that is OK. The point is that they are trustworthy, close to you, and a healthy view of what a good relationship should look like.\n \n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n**The emotional distance from our parents** This kills me the most. Our parents disowned for us for a few years before accepting us back into their lives. But - there is distance. Words were said that cannot be taken back ever. My dad, who was my best friend and hero, and remains my hero, said things that make me cry, make me angry, and make me cringe to even remember. He seems to have forgiven Sarah, if that's possible while strongly hating our lifestyle. But the coldness in his voice, even though he still talks to me, is unmistakable. I'm truly happy that my sister has a relationship with our parents which seems to have largely survived after the revelation. But, I think as the older brother, I took the brunt of the blame for causing this situation to happen. We talk on the phone, we meet for holidays. But for the most part I feel like I'm talking to two people who are constantly deciding between loving me and hating me and are bouncing back between the two. There are all kinds of stories here about how everything worked out great when people told their parents. I don't know how that's possible. This shit hurts and it hurts really badly. \n\nI'm grateful we aren't totally cut off. I'm grateful they talk to me at all. They were incredible parents and raised us with an incredible amount of love and involvement in our lives - which is perhaps why this current state of affairs is painful for me. Sarah feels it too but sometimes I feel like she hurts for me because they still see her as the golden child. There's no answer to this - it is just a constant work in progress. One thing my parents know is that I still love them, and care for them. I check in on them as much as I can. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n \n\n**He/She can be a hypercritic of your personal narrative** Everyone likes telling their spouse the stories from their childhood, their adversity, how this thing happened or that thing happened. Sometimes, the stories are a little dressed up to paint you in a positive way that a sibling who was there might not agree with. If you marry your sibling - it is having someone with all the knowledge of a sibling plus all the knowledge of a spouse - in one person. They are hyperaware of you as a human being, and know your most embarrassing moments. They know your deep, dark garbage too, some of your secrets, and your lesser-than-stellar moral and ethical performances as a child, tween, teen, or young adult. They know all the times and the ways you were embarrassed. You can rarely get away with telling a story from your past to her where you're the hero unless you really were the hero. \n\nSolution: I reflect on the fact that she loves me anyway. Sarah does the same. We know the deepest, darkest, stupidest, most ridiculous shit about each other. But we chose to love each other, and chose each other out of everyone else in the world. We chose the difficulty and challenges of this over an easier life because we love each other. I accept her worst because I know her worst. And she mine. There's something poetic in this. Something beautiful and true and good and absolutely wonderful. To know the worst of someone, their every weakness in time, and say: \"I love you with all of the flaws that you have.\" Spouses can do this all the time, but I have to say - there's something that makes a sibling-spouse situation cause you to have to overcome A LOT more flaws - because you simply know more.\n \n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n**Not finding good places to get help with your situation** We haven't done counseling in some time now, but when we did need to find a counselor, we'd e-mail anonymously and share our situation. We got turned down over and over and over again with people who simply did not want to deal with us at all. It was pretty difficult. We finally found someone who counseled all kinds of situations and non-traditional relationships. She was open, and I was worried she was open because maybe she had low demand. Found out this was not the case. She was incredible at her job, and showed us that most of our marriage problems stemmed from the same forces that any marriage has to face. We just had some exacerbation because of our circumstances. \n\nSurprisingly, she taught us that the same circumstances also gave us an incredible set of tools - understanding each other so well also meant we had the power to overcome gaps in communication better than many other couples might. This was absolutely right. Being siblings did give us a natural ability to communicate our exact, precise feelings to each other and be honest, faster than this process might otherwise. I can't thank her enough for this, but she actually *utilized* our sibling relationship to help improve our marriage. What kind of master counselor can pull off that magic? Her. Total genius.\n \n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n**Lack of support in supporting family** If Mom gets sick, who has to drop everything in managing this household, and fly out? If Dad gets sick. If both aren't doing well. If someone has a surgery? Normal families can take shifts so that one sibling can live normal life, house, kids, school, job, while the other takes a week off, takes care of stuff at home, and then goes back to their own family. Tag, you're it, and the other sibling flies and does the same. If you have a few brothers and sisters, you can manage this on a cycle and it can be a symphony if you work together in taking care of your parents. Us - not so much. If one of us goes, the other has to handle everything else on our own at home - and obviously, miss the other person. \n\nThere isn't really a way of getting around this. We encourage our parents to go to the doctor regularly, we try to keep up their house even from afar and make sure they aren't ignoring any potential issues like a leaky roof. Our parents are pretty self-sufficient, but we know as they get older, this will be an issue eventually. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n \n**The fear of losing the other person** When you lose a spouse, your world breaks for a while. And you lean on your sister or brother. When you lose a sibling, your world also breaks for a while, and you lean on your spouse. If both are one person, and is the love of your life - there's no one to lean on at this level. You're just alone. Even typing this out makes me feel sick and teary eyed. This part just sucks, especially the inevitability of it.\n \n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n**Lack of outside information for healthy patterns** Spouses come from two different households, and that means two different ways of doing things. One's parents may have valued money more than time. The other, time more than money. One could have valued how a house looked, and another valued more how full it was at all times. These different ways of looking at households, family, life, can come together in a couple and help them out by bringing fresh ideas from the other person that you didn't have to begin with. You learn from your spouse's experience and from her family's values. Some of those values combine with your own and you create your own unique set of values. Not us. We grew up close, as normal siblings, in a family that was pretty well-adjusted but is still imperfect. There's no one here to bring in a new set of ideas and tell us we are doing something wrong. The way we run our home is patterned heavily on our parents and on our experiences. Some things we decided to change drastically, others we kept. But overall, both of us can only reference the way we grew up together. \n\nWe deal with this by reading A LOT. We read a ton of books on family, marriage, relationships, households, home finance. We try to get as much information as possible from outside perspectives on how people run their families. We love hearing stories, and hearing how other people do things. We ask friends about their own lives. This is probably pretty normal, but I think we do this more consciously than most when we realized this was an issue we needed to remedy.\n \n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n**Fear of hurting the other person** My wife is my sister. She's the love of my life and also my best friend since I was 2 years old. There are things I can say to her that would shatter her, and things she could say to me that could break me. We haven't had these rough fights for years now, but even when we did, we made a conscious effort not to cross certain lines. Certain things, you can't take back and that is true for all relationships. In this one, you hurt the other person twice. I feel like marrying a sibling is having the power to have TWICE as much love in your relationship, and TWICE as much potential for harm and hurt. \n\nWe really try to watch our words when we fight, and we've both agreed we would rather walk out of a room with a fight going on, and have silence, than say something we will regret later.\n \n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n**Easy to fall back into roommate patterns if don't keep things romantic/interesting. Easier than it is for most normal couples.** Everyone struggles with this - that feeling that you are roommates. Perhaps even brother and sister. Well, we are! It is so incredibly easy for us to fall into the patterns of routine. Families run on routine and that's how they run well. If we don't pay attention to romance, sensuality, and attraction in our lives for each other's sake - we easily could (and have) fallen into boring routines. \n\nWe read books, try online surveys, watch videos, try new ideas, and try to stay in shape. The last one has gotten harder for me as we've grown, but seems to be easy for her because she loves running. I have to consciously schedule time to workout and it feels like work. Nevertheless, romance and sexuality are the products of conscious work as you age in a relationship, not just waking up and being ready to go at it. We use separate bathrooms which is a HUGE benefit in our relationship. We try to keep a little mystery as hard as that can be. Bottom line - being roommates is natural for us. Our attraction developed naturally too but these two sides are at odds so we put work into making attraction win.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n**Guilt** We both came from a fairly traditional family so there was definitely some ingrained guilt that what we both felt was wrong. This guilt didn't just disappear when we began our relationship, magically. It doesn't disappear regardless of what these stories say, many of which it is fair to doubt the reality of. The guilt around incest is deeply rooted, and you have to expend effort to root it out. It requires intellectually engaging with each of the reasons why people say incest is wrong, and refuting them in your mind and heart. I can't speak for the general sibling-incest population since we haven't actually reached out to meet others like us in real life and don't plan to - but we fell in love. We didn't ask for this and we didn't plan it. Incest was incidental to our story, it wasn't the goal. In order for us to be OK, truly OK with being together though, we had to embrace incest itself. Justifying it for ourselves and even seeing the positives. We had to REVEL in the fact that we were siblings and almost...develop the fetish/kink/whatever. We didn't start out loving the concept of incest. We developed an appreciation and understanding of it as a result of our relationship. So for us, dealing with guilt was to go past justification and instead: embrace it entirely. Be happy about it. Love it. Love that it's her and not someone else. Develop the kink and it will add significantly to the relationship's emotional stability.\n",

TV shows portray tells as like some kind of secret physical code where you can tell because a hair on their eyelash is vibrating out of sync with the rest etc etc. We know when the other person is lying almost always just from voice alone. Tone is enough. I come home, she asks me how my day was, and I say: &amp;quot;It was good!&amp;quot; because she texted me how tired she is before I got home and I don&amp;#39;t want to burden her with my day. She knows immediately my day wasn&amp;#39;t all that good because of the tone. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The lying breaks trust, like in any relationship, and even though we let each other get away with small things, in general - we just try really hard not to lie to each other. It is hard, because everyone lies. Everyone lies to their spouse at some level, sometimes says something passive-aggressive, something. We found that it is doubly destructive to us because we know we aren&amp;#39;t &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; getting away with it. So - we tell the truth. Sounds simple enough but it is not. It is hard to state every grievance almost immediately so that it doesn&amp;#39;t sit and to maintain the environment of honesty. Sometimes, you don&amp;#39;t want to share what you&amp;#39;re upset about and that should be OK. We&amp;#39;ve gotten to a point where we admit something is bothering us and ask if we can talk about it later. This way, we don&amp;#39;t cover up things or brush them under the rug, and at the same time, don&amp;#39;t feel stifled and claustrophobic living with a person you love with all your heart but pretty much can&amp;#39;t hide anything from.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Largely cutting off friends from your old life who you can&amp;#39;t trust with your secret&lt;/strong&gt; This was one of the most difficult aspects of this life. We lost a lot of friends. We didn&amp;#39;t break ties with them formally or anything. We just disappeared. We&amp;#39;re not on social media. We&amp;#39;re not on LinkedIn. We&amp;#39;re not easy to find if someone looked for us. Emotionally, this was tough on us when we made the decision to be together. We lost a lot of close friends and people that enriched our lives since we were kids. There are a small handful that know we live together, and there are a smaller handful that know about the relationship. This is a huge sacrifice that cannot be overestimated in terms of its impact on your social lives. There is no way of getting around this other than to build new friendships with people who don&amp;#39;t know you from your origin. They know you grew up in the same town. You don&amp;#39;t provide a lot of historical details, but you engage in an otherwise honest relationship with them. It is sometimes surreal to me that we&amp;#39;ve thrown parties for our friends, had them come over and hang out with us, and for years, they know us as nothing more than a regular family that lives on the block. These friendships are really important, because that becomes your social life. Sacrificing some of your best friendships because you simply are not sure if they will accept you, messes you up a little. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The inability to rely on each other for relationship help&lt;/strong&gt; Normally, siblings will call each other up when struggling in a relationship and have a shoulder to learn on. We don&amp;#39;t. It is only the two of us. So when we do need a shoulder to lean on about the relationship - which is not too often anymore but still happens from time to time - it has to be a friend. There&amp;#39;s no other answer to this except one. You each need one or two really, really close friends that you can talk to about your marriage. It helps if they know the secret about your marriage, but even if they don&amp;#39;t - that is OK. The point is that they are trustworthy, close to you, and a healthy view of what a good relationship should look like.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The emotional distance from our parents&lt;/strong&gt; This kills me the most. Our parents disowned for us for a few years before accepting us back into their lives. But - there is distance. Words were said that cannot be taken back ever. My dad, who was my best friend and hero, and remains my hero, said things that make me cry, make me angry, and make me cringe to even remember. He seems to have forgiven Sarah, if that&amp;#39;s possible while strongly hating our lifestyle. But the coldness in his voice, even though he still talks to me, is unmistakable. I&amp;#39;m truly happy that my sister has a relationship with our parents which seems to have largely survived after the revelation. But, I think as the older brother, I took the brunt of the blame for causing this situation to happen. We talk on the phone, we meet for holidays. But for the most part I feel like I&amp;#39;m talking to two people who are constantly deciding between loving me and hating me and are bouncing back between the two. There are all kinds of stories here about how everything worked out great when people told their parents. I don&amp;#39;t know how that&amp;#39;s possible. This shit hurts and it hurts really badly. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m grateful we aren&amp;#39;t totally cut off. I&amp;#39;m grateful they talk to me at all. They were incredible parents and raised us with an incredible amount of love and involvement in our lives - which is perhaps why this current state of affairs is painful for me. Sarah feels it too but sometimes I feel like she hurts for me because they still see her as the golden child. There&amp;#39;s no answer to this - it is just a constant work in progress. One thing my parents know is that I still love them, and care for them. I check in on them as much as I can. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;He/She can be a hypercritic of your personal narrative&lt;/strong&gt; Everyone likes telling their spouse the stories from their childhood, their adversity, how this thing happened or that thing happened. Sometimes, the stories are a little dressed up to paint you in a positive way that a sibling who was there might not agree with. If you marry your sibling - it is having someone with all the knowledge of a sibling plus all the knowledge of a spouse - in one person. They are hyperaware of you as a human being, and know your most embarrassing moments. They know your deep, dark garbage too, some of your secrets, and your lesser-than-stellar moral and ethical performances as a child, tween, teen, or young adult. They know all the times and the ways you were embarrassed. You can rarely get away with telling a story from your past to her where you&amp;#39;re the hero unless you really were the hero. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Solution: I reflect on the fact that she loves me anyway. Sarah does the same. We know the deepest, darkest, stupidest, most ridiculous shit about each other. But we chose to love each other, and chose each other out of everyone else in the world. We chose the difficulty and challenges of this over an easier life because we love each other. I accept her worst because I know her worst. And she mine. There&amp;#39;s something poetic in this. Something beautiful and true and good and absolutely wonderful. To know the worst of someone, their every weakness in time, and say: &amp;quot;I love you with all of the flaws that you have.&amp;quot; Spouses can do this all the time, but I have to say - there&amp;#39;s something that makes a sibling-spouse situation cause you to have to overcome A LOT more flaws - because you simply know more.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not finding good places to get help with your situation&lt;/strong&gt; We haven&amp;#39;t done counseling in some time now, but when we did need to find a counselor, we&amp;#39;d e-mail anonymously and share our situation. We got turned down over and over and over again with people who simply did not want to deal with us at all. It was pretty difficult. We finally found someone who counseled all kinds of situations and non-traditional relationships. She was open, and I was worried she was open because maybe she had low demand. Found out this was not the case. She was incredible at her job, and showed us that most of our marriage problems stemmed from the same forces that any marriage has to face. We just had some exacerbation because of our circumstances. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, she taught us that the same circumstances also gave us an incredible set of tools - understanding each other so well also meant we had the power to overcome gaps in communication better than many other couples might. This was absolutely right. Being siblings did give us a natural ability to communicate our exact, precise feelings to each other and be honest, faster than this process might otherwise. I can&amp;#39;t thank her enough for this, but she actually &lt;em&gt;utilized&lt;/em&gt; our sibling relationship to help improve our marriage. What kind of master counselor can pull off that magic? Her. Total genius.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lack of support in supporting family&lt;/strong&gt; If Mom gets sick, who has to drop everything in managing this household, and fly out? If Dad gets sick. If both aren&amp;#39;t doing well. If someone has a surgery? Normal families can take shifts so that one sibling can live normal life, house, kids, school, job, while the other takes a week off, takes care of stuff at home, and then goes back to their own family. Tag, you&amp;#39;re it, and the other sibling flies and does the same. If you have a few brothers and sisters, you can manage this on a cycle and it can be a symphony if you work together in taking care of your parents. Us - not so much. If one of us goes, the other has to handle everything else on our own at home - and obviously, miss the other person. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There isn&amp;#39;t really a way of getting around this. We encourage our parents to go to the doctor regularly, we try to keep up their house even from afar and make sure they aren&amp;#39;t ignoring any potential issues like a leaky roof. Our parents are pretty self-sufficient, but we know as they get older, this will be an issue eventually. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The fear of losing the other person&lt;/strong&gt; When you lose a spouse, your world breaks for a while. And you lean on your sister or brother. When you lose a sibling, your world also breaks for a while, and you lean on your spouse. If both are one person, and is the love of your life - there&amp;#39;s no one to lean on at this level. You&amp;#39;re just alone. Even typing this out makes me feel sick and teary eyed. This part just sucks, especially the inevitability of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lack of outside information for healthy patterns&lt;/strong&gt; Spouses come from two different households, and that means two different ways of doing things. One&amp;#39;s parents may have valued money more than time. The other, time more than money. One could have valued how a house looked, and another valued more how full it was at all times. These different ways of looking at households, family, life, can come together in a couple and help them out by bringing fresh ideas from the other person that you didn&amp;#39;t have to begin with. You learn from your spouse&amp;#39;s experience and from her family&amp;#39;s values. Some of those values combine with your own and you create your own unique set of values. Not us. We grew up close, as normal siblings, in a family that was pretty well-adjusted but is still imperfect. There&amp;#39;s no one here to bring in a new set of ideas and tell us we are doing something wrong. The way we run our home is patterned heavily on our parents and on our experiences. Some things we decided to change drastically, others we kept. But overall, both of us can only reference the way we grew up together. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We deal with this by reading A LOT. We read a ton of books on family, marriage, relationships, households, home finance. We try to get as much information as possible from outside perspectives on how people run their families. We love hearing stories, and hearing how other people do things. We ask friends about their own lives. This is probably pretty normal, but I think we do this more consciously than most when we realized this was an issue we needed to remedy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fear of hurting the other person&lt;/strong&gt; My wife is my sister. She&amp;#39;s the love of my life and also my best friend since I was 2 years old. There are things I can say to her that would shatter her, and things she could say to me that could break me. We haven&amp;#39;t had these rough fights for years now, but even when we did, we made a conscious effort not to cross certain lines. Certain things, you can&amp;#39;t take back and that is true for all relationships. In this one, you hurt the other person twice. I feel like marrying a sibling is having the power to have TWICE as much love in your relationship, and TWICE as much potential for harm and hurt. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We really try to watch our words when we fight, and we&amp;#39;ve both agreed we would rather walk out of a room with a fight going on, and have silence, than say something we will regret later.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Easy to fall back into roommate patterns if don&amp;#39;t keep things romantic/interesting. Easier than it is for most normal couples.&lt;/strong&gt; Everyone struggles with this - that feeling that you are roommates. Perhaps even brother and sister. Well, we are! It is so incredibly easy for us to fall into the patterns of routine. Families run on routine and that&amp;#39;s how they run well. If we don&amp;#39;t pay attention to romance, sensuality, and attraction in our lives for each other&amp;#39;s sake - we easily could (and have) fallen into boring routines. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We read books, try online surveys, watch videos, try new ideas, and try to stay in shape. The last one has gotten harder for me as we&amp;#39;ve grown, but seems to be easy for her because she loves running. I have to consciously schedule time to workout and it feels like work. Nevertheless, romance and sexuality are the products of conscious work as you age in a relationship, not just waking up and being ready to go at it. We use separate bathrooms which is a HUGE benefit in our relationship. We try to keep a little mystery as hard as that can be. Bottom line - being roommates is natural for us. Our attraction developed naturally too but these two sides are at odds so we put work into making attraction win.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Guilt&lt;/strong&gt; We both came from a fairly traditional family so there was definitely some ingrained guilt that what we both felt was wrong. This guilt didn&amp;#39;t just disappear when we began our relationship, magically. It doesn&amp;#39;t disappear regardless of what these stories say, many of which it is fair to doubt the reality of. The guilt around incest is deeply rooted, and you have to expend effort to root it out. It requires intellectually engaging with each of the reasons why people say incest is wrong, and refuting them in your mind and heart. I can&amp;#39;t speak for the general sibling-incest population since we haven&amp;#39;t actually reached out to meet others like us in real life and don&amp;#39;t plan to - but we fell in love. We didn&amp;#39;t ask for this and we didn&amp;#39;t plan it. Incest was incidental to our story, it wasn&amp;#39;t the goal. In order for us to be OK, truly OK with being together though, we had to embrace incest itself. Justifying it for ourselves and even seeing the positives. We had to REVEL in the fact that we were siblings and almost...develop the fetish/kink/whatever. We didn&amp;#39;t start out loving the concept of incest. We developed an appreciation and understanding of it as a result of our relationship. So for us, dealing with guilt was to go past justification and instead: embrace it entirely. Be happy about it. Love it. Love that it&amp;#39;s her and not someone else. Develop the kink and it will add significantly to the relationship&amp;#39;s emotional stability.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
