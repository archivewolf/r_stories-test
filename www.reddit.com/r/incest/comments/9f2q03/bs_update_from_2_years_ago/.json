                        "selftext": "So I haven't used this account in about 2 years. I will briefly summarize. My sister and I had a consensual sexual relationship throughout our youth and into adulthood. We continued having sex on and off even after we got married and she had a child (not mine). A couple years ago my sister came over at thanksgiving and we had sex. However, after posting on here and /r/confession, my sister and I talked about what we were doing and decided that though we both enjoyed each other, it was technically cheating and decided to stop.\n\nWe were good since then, in that we did not have sex and though we still flirted on and off, we have not done anything more than me sending her a dick pic. Although, it was a let down that her response was just \"good old days\" and then we stopped talking for a few weeks. \n\nThings have changed a lot since my last post and the dick pic. My wife and I divorced. I wish I could say it was something like an affair or something, but it wasn't. It was just a lot of little things. In the end, we both admitted that we weren't happy and we went out separate ways. I know one of you will say, \"you should have kept sleeping with your sister!\" I don't think so. To be honest we got together and stayed together out of chance and comfort. I don't think either one of us was truly happy from the time we started dating and answer to \"should we continue\" was \"why not?\" because... well, why not?\n\nWe have remained friends after the divorce, which is good - I still care about her, but I can tell we are both happier not being married.\n\nAfter the divorce I did my best not to try to sleep with my sister, which involved joining the whole \"MGTOW\" movement. I figured that my sister was just an AWALT (look it up if you don't know) since she cheated on her husband... I know, i'm a hypocrite, but regardless it kept me away from her and allowed me to not mess anything up for her.\n\nSo, last year I also got into fitness and trying to \"better\" myself. Like anyone, I gained some weight after getting married and as I got older and I figured i'm not getting any younger. So I made it a point to go to the gym and lose some of the pudge around my middle. I'm not buff by any measure, just leaner now and healthier. The consequence, though, is that my sex drive went through the roof.\n\nHere we go. So, I managed to keep my divorce from family for almost a year. We live in different states, I hardly see them, and it's none of their business. However, word spread and my mom told sister who called me up. We talked and I tried to be cool about everything, but I can't deny that as soon as I heard her voice I started thinking about us being younger and the first times... etc. Well, she invited me to go on vacation with her and her husband and my niece at a lake house that his family has in Wisconsin. I didn't say yes or no, using work, and tried to keep my mind out of the gutter.\n\nI'll be honest. My sex drive started to control my thoughts. Idecided I wanted to go and asked my boss if I could take those two weeks off. He said \"sure\" without hesitation. I was happy... but I had that... jittery... nervousness that I used to get as a boy when I started dating, something I never had with my sister before.\n\nwell, I decided to drive instead of fly and met them there. Everything started out okay, hello's and missed you's and all that with her husband and her niece, then I saw my sister. She too had turned to exercise and managed to lose most of her baby-weight. She still had a bit of a pouch, but looked like the teenage girl that I learned about sex with. Anyway, we complemented each other on our weight loss, and continued with the vacation.\n\nAt first, everything was fine. My nervousness went away and when I saw my sister kissing her husband, my sexual thoughts died. I didn't want to mess anything up and they seemed happy. \n\nAfter a few days, we finally had a day without boating or dinner dates or any other plans, just a relaxing day to do whatever we wanted. So I decided to go for a nice long hike. It being Wisconsin in the summer, there were fucking mosquitos. Neither my sister or I get bitten that much, but her husband and daughter were eaten alive the first day at the cabin. So, as I readied myself I asked if anyone else wanted to go, but only my sister said yes. She wanted to be physically active to.\n\nWe left in the morning, but it was already pretty hot. After a couple hours of hiking, we decided to stop for lunch and started talking. We talked while we were walking, but it was all the typical noise of our parents, her husband, her kid in school, my work, exercise, my sister running a half marathon, etc. When we stopped for lunch, we got more personal In our topics. We talked about the past couple years, about how my wife and I stayed friends, and about our previous sex life. She agreed with me that the fitness focus was partially out of frustration. I said it was part of my new philosophy and she said the same, but admitted that she also thought about sex with me a lot more, now that she couldn't have it. I told her that I felt the same, and that I thought about sex on the drive, but that when I saw her and her husband I stopped in my tracks. \n\nShe smiled and said well... she had been thinking about it too. Then... we headed back, no kiss, no wilderness romp, nothing. We headed back and for another 2 hours we talked about times when we were young, when we had gone camping with our parents and quietly had sex in the \"kids tent\" our parents called it.\n\nAfter we got back, we showered (separately) and her husband prepared steaks. Later that night, we both went out to the dock and shared a couple of beers before going to bed. \n\nAfter the trip I went home with a bit of sadness. I wanted sex so bad with her, more than I want to admit to myself, but nothing happened. I have been cursing myself for the last month that I didn't try harder. \n\nWell... that brings us to today. My sister and I have been texting again and said that she has been working out really hard, and now her muscles are a lot stronger. I told her great. Then she asked if I want to see, and I said sure. So she sent me a video of her vagina and showing how hard she can squeeze her finger. At the end she panned the phone up to her face, smiled, and winked. I told her that it was awesome and hot, but she had to go do something with her daughter. \n\nNow i'm on reddit posting about it. ",

If i have touched on something you think is wrong i am sorry it may just have came out wrong. I hope it helps you or your sister or even people whom read it.\n  Well as you mentioned you have grown up seeing your sister as a female and i have read that siblings say when they engage in sexual stuff and sex itself. It is was like they are built for each other, there are plenty out there that do it once but the social wall built to keep us slaves in line forces them to really pretend that it didn't happen and lie to themselves that it was truly like being one person designed precisely that way. There is a mythology that we were originally created with two heads i think two arms two legs but the creator was fearful of there power splitting them in half including the heart. This is the reason we walk the earth in search for that someone mostly settling for who ever.\n\nAsia used to form weddings for twins as the believed they used to have sex in the womb, also alowing siblings too. The Germanic had similar standings as well England. Incest is just something that was common for a long while, it is just some not all but the rare ones had a great connection and trust, smell is a big thing you could like someone but their sexual scent doesn't work causing a once off. But i don't know why you denied being together as in relationship both parties feel completely drawn, and stopping it causes frustration. Honestly that just would hurt others. They talk about siblings being together hurt people but, more seems just like any normal situations trying to ignore or move on from a partner you seem to love deeply in body, mind and spirit if it is just that you both only enjoy each other sexually then I'm wrong. Yes being together would cause being careful of the ideals forced into certain cultured countries. \n\nI just feel that yeah she looked happy with her husband but it could be social standards that is expected of her, appearances, if it hurt you it hurt her watching you do the same. If you hold her back from sex with you i feel she will become irritated to a point of fights and possibility a similar out come of divorce. You both tried to do what was socially excepted, but just reading this seems wrong to be with people if you can't help but probably think of them while engaging in sex with a different person. Seems you both have a strong connection. You have two choices, completely avoid each other with no contact to prevent hurting others or become a couple. Yeah it will be hard with her child, but could be better than sexual frustrated petty arguments on her side, sending that video is proof. Should let her read this it might clear fog. But i dont understand why you never continued being a regular couple. Or you enjoy drama lol. But forget the people throwing negative comments, it's not a nice to have a partner think the relationship isn't an open one. If you do both harbour feelings of both wanting a normal relationship together. A discussion about it, but avoiding each other seems to just do as the saying suggests of making the heart grow stronger and everyone can agree it seems that way. Even masturbating 8 times before seeing her I'm sure it isn't going to make a difference. Sorry for the long comment i just find it hurts reading something that feels people lie and become convinced but your own lies. It can cause a break down health problems, excessive ageing. \n\nBoth read this and really think what you want, at the end of the day you will never keep everyone happy, and denial of your own happiness is as bad as doing it to others, she could come clean to her husband and try work out something or live the fantasy Disney dream that everyone are thinking are what we are meant to do. Treat people as you would yourself, but that doesn't mean to hurt yourself because you can't do something for others if you can't do it for yourself. Like cutting yourself with a razor, you wouldn't do it to someone then why would you do it to yourself, if you kind of get the analogy. \n\nThanks for reading i hope you work yourself out, people become so busy as we are always doing something clouds the mind. Remember you have one life. Also people don't need to know your business. I am a tran female and i dont mind letting people know things about it, as even i learnt things like in India there used to be trans woman they used to have a special name i forget, and were respected but when the English came in they forced their catholic views into them so over time it became taboo and they were forced to go underground. So now they harbour hate and disgust that makes them sick. Eg. I personally only find people sexually with animals off putting. But true trans meaning is removing male or hormone you don't want and replacing it with estrogen, so just like that the whole body reshapes and everything becomes as if you are in my case female, but there are some men that just increase oestrogen in the system and get surgery to look like woman. They don't transition into one and still function as male. Mostly known as Shemales as its common for gay porn actors to do. It's what C.Jenner is as has caused confusion they consider themselves as a straight male. People don't ask what a woman's genitals shape and look is, trans woman get it. It's annoying explaining that logic. \n\nBut i dont see sibling couples abnormal, the defects people claim as defence to back their disapproval as people do for nearly everything, even research for claims usually done by people with negative ideals find and claim incomplete results to force that opinion, positive people on the subject will take in account a number of results. Just think people over react about sibling dating, making it illegal in places is stupid. Forcing someone like myself to be among strong big men as i use a bathroom is scary. Most trans dress normal, some people think we wear heavy makeup and wear clubbing type clothing every day. Can't believe it is illegal to pee. Luckily i blend in and nobody can tell. But still guess holidays in US is no go, people also think its off that in Japan 13 is legal sexual age 15 they can claim independence if parents get in the way. Also at 14 woman can marry, men at 18. So a 22+ teacher could be married to a 14yr old but it is kept hush that's if it is if as long as it wasn't done while they both were at the school. That is what i remember but things change, like legal sex age was 12 in Japan they increased it to 13. \n\nI apologise if i got what you both feel wrong but at least if it does happen she can have a different last name lol \ud83d\ude01. I'll be waiting for updates, love is what we all seem to lack and others. Hi to your sister if she reads this hope you're well and both accept your choice. \n",

It&amp;#39;s annoying explaining that logic. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But i dont see sibling couples abnormal, the defects people claim as defence to back their disapproval as people do for nearly everything, even research for claims usually done by people with negative ideals find and claim incomplete results to force that opinion, positive people on the subject will take in account a number of results. Just think people over react about sibling dating, making it illegal in places is stupid. Forcing someone like myself to be among strong big men as i use a bathroom is scary. Most trans dress normal, some people think we wear heavy makeup and wear clubbing type clothing every day. Can&amp;#39;t believe it is illegal to pee. Luckily i blend in and nobody can tell. But still guess holidays in US is no go, people also think its off that in Japan 13 is legal sexual age 15 they can claim independence if parents get in the way. Also at 14 woman can marry, men at 18. So a 22+ teacher could be married to a 14yr old but it is kept hush that&amp;#39;s if it is if as long as it wasn&amp;#39;t done while they both were at the school. That is what i remember but things change, like legal sex age was 12 in Japan they increased it to 13. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I apologise if i got what you both feel wrong but at least if it does happen she can have a different last name lol \ud83d\ude01. I&amp;#39;ll be waiting for updates, love is what we all seem to lack and others. Hi to your sister if she reads this hope you&amp;#39;re well and both accept your choice. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
