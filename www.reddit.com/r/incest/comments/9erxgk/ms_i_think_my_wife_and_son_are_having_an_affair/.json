We were a little busy with family arrangements and business in our personal lives that *needed* doing, but for the most part, we just hung out with each other, which we don't have a lot of time to do anymore. We actually talked about having our son back home, and we both agreed that although he needs to get a job, it's nice to have him back in the house. y wife did actually say, \"He's definitely not our little boy anymore, he's his own man, and I couldn't be happier about it.\" I wasn't overly suspicious about the comment if anything, it put me slightly back towards them not having an affair.\n\nWhen I could, I checked up on all the comments of the previous update and one thing kept being said to me both in the comments and in the private messages... that I should get cameras and put them all over my house to catch all their activities.\n\nThe other thing that was said, was that I needed to figure out what I actually wanted from this, because it was very unclear from the way I wrote it, and after a while, I realised I couldn't answer those questions because I didn't know the answer myself. So, I decided to do something I've not done in a long time today and took a day off work. \n\nI had a lot of overtime built up, so it didn't cost one of my holiday days. My wife left for work and I decided to get up about the same time I would anyway, so I gave her a kiss on the way out. The rest of my day I decided that I was going to figure out the answer to one serious question to do with my wife and son:\n\n* Do I want them to be having an affair?\n\nIt took a long time to think about, most of the morning I spend just sitting and thinking through in my head about it, doing things that required no brain effort so that I could think about the answer in my head. I then decided I needed to get out of the house and clear my head after having lunch, and went for a short walk around where we live (out in the countryside, so it's a nice short walk). Then it hit me like a ton of bricks out on that walk, what I wanted out of all this came to light. I guess it was just letting it all rest for a while as my subconscious took over the problem, it was all brought together in one sentence I wrote on my phone\n\n* I want them to have an affair, and I want to catch them.\n\nI know that's a very specific fetish, but my god, that is... well I would love that. I just really really want to get them fucking each other, know about it in secret, and then catch them at my pleasure. I would want them to continue afterwards, not have a threesome, but it would be so good to catch them and my son continue to show his affections towards his mother.\n\nSo I guess my next stage is figuring out if they are currently having an affair. So, I decided to do what a lot of you told me to do in the last post, I ordered a few small cameras that can be hidden around the house so I can see what they're currently doing, and if they're doing anything at all.",
